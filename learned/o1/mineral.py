    """
    Determines if a molecule is a mineral based on its SMILES string.

    Due to the complexity of accurately classifying minerals, which involves properties beyond chemical structure (such as crystalline form and geological origin), this function is unable to provide a reliable classification based solely on the SMILES string.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        None, None: Classification cannot be performed based on SMILES alone.
