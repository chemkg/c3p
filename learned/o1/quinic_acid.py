    Determines if a molecule is a quinic acid or its derivative based on its SMILES string.
    Quinic acid is a cyclitol carboxylic acid - a cyclohexane ring with multiple hydroxyl groups (or their derivatives) and a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a quinic acid or derivative, False otherwise
