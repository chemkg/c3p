    Determines if a molecule is a mucopolysaccharide based on its SMILES string.
    Mucopolysaccharides are polysaccharides composed of alternating units from uronic acids and glycosamines,
    and commonly partially esterified with sulfuric acid.

        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
