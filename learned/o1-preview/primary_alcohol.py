    """
    Determines if a molecule is a primary alcohol based on its SMILES string.
    A primary alcohol is a compound in which a hydroxy group (-OH) is attached to a saturated carbon atom
    which has either three hydrogen atoms attached to it (methanol), or only one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms attached to it (i.e., R-CHâ‚‚OH).
