def is_semisynthetic_derivative(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a semisynthetic derivative based on its SMILES string.
    Since this requires knowledge of the molecule's origin and synthetic history,
    which cannot be inferred from the SMILES alone, this function cannot classify the molecule.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
