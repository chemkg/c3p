    """
    Determines if a molecule is a lipopolysaccharide based on its SMILES string.
    
    Lipopolysaccharides are complex molecules consisting of a trisaccharide repeating unit
    (two heptose units and octulosonic acid) with oligosaccharide side chains and 
    3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid units.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool or None: True if molecule is a lipopolysaccharide, False otherwise or None if classification is not possible
        str or None: Reason for classification or None if not classified
