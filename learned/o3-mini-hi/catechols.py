Classifies: Catechols (Any compound containing an o-diphenol component)

A catechol is defined as a molecule containing a benzene ring with two hydroxyl (-OH)
substituents in adjacent (ortho) positions. In this implementation we use a SMARTS pattern
that represents 1,2-dihydroxybenzene. Note that this pattern will match a benzene ring
with adjacent â€“OH groups even if there are extra substituents on the ring.
