def is_butenolide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a butenolide based on its SMILES string.
    A butenolide is defined as a gamma-lactone that consists of a 2-furanone skeleton and its substituted derivatives.
    This means the molecule must contain a five-membered ring (the lactone ring) in which:
      - One ring carbon is double-bonded to an exocyclic oxygen (the lactone carbonyl).
      - There is at least one double bond (unsaturation) among the ring bonds to recall the 2-furanone skeleton.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a butenolide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
