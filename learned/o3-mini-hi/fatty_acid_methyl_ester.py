Classifies: Fatty acid methyl ester
A fatty acid methyl ester is defined as a fatty acid ester that is the carboxylic ester obtained
by the formal condensation of a fatty acid with methanol.
The algorithm first finds the methyl ester substructure [CX3](=O)O[CH3] and then examines 
the acyl portion (the R in R-C(=O)OCH3). For an R-group to be considered a fatty acid chain, 
we require that it consists primarily of carbon atoms and that if it is long (â‰¥5 carbons) it is
sufficiently flexible (i.e. contains many rotatable bonds). For short chains (<5 carbons) we use 
a minimum carbon count criterion.

def is_fatty_acid_methyl_ester(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a fatty acid methyl ester based on its SMILES string.
    It first looks for the methyl ester group [CX3](=O)O[CH3]. Then it identifies the acyl chain
    attached to the carbonyl carbon (excluding the carbonyl O) and computes its characteristics:
      - number of carbon atoms in the chain (chain_length)
      - number of rotatable bonds in that chain (acyl_rotatable).
      
    For chains with at least 5 carbon atoms, we require a minimum flexibility 
    (acyl_rotatable >= chain_length*0.5, rounded to an integer) to qualify as a fatty acid. 
    For chains shorter than 5 carbons, we accept a minimum chain length of 3 carbons.
