def is_sesquiterpenoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a sesquiterpenoid based on its SMILES string.
    Sesquiterpenoids are derived from sesquiterpenes (C15 skeleton) but may have rearrangements or modifications.
    This heuristic extracts the Murcko scaffold (the core scaffold) and counts the number of carbon atoms.
    If the core has roughly 15 carbons (allowing a window of 13 to 16 to tolerate minor modifications),
    the molecule is considered a sesquiterpenoid.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a sesquiterpenoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
