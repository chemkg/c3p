"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18035 diglyceride
"""
"""
Classifies: Diglyceride â€“ a glyceride in which any two of the three hydroxy groups of glycerol are acylated.
A proper diglyceride should have a glycerol backbone with exactly two acyl (ester) groups attached and one free hydroxyl.
We attempt to detect two possible glycerol backbone arrangements:
 - sn-1,2-diacylglycerol: CH2(OC(=O)*) - CH(OC(=O)*) - CH2(O)
 - sn-1,3-diacylglycerol: CH2(OC(=O)*) - CH(O) - CH2(OC(=O)*)
The SMARTS patterns below use "*" as a wildcard in place of "[*]" (which previously led to failed substructure queries).

def is_diglyceride(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a diglyceride (diacylglycerol) based on its SMILES string.
    A diglyceride is defined as glycerol in which any two of the three hydroxy groups are acylated.
    
    This implementation checks for two common backbone patterns:
      - sn-1,2-diacylglycerol: CH2(OC(=O)*) - CH(OC(=O)*) - CH2(O)
      - sn-1,3-diacylglycerol: CH2(OC(=O)*) - CH(O) - CH2(OC(=O)*)
    
    If either pattern is found, along with a reasonable molecular weight, the molecule is classified as a diglyceride.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
