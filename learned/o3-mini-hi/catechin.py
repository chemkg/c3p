def is_catechin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule belongs to the catechin class based on its SMILES string.
    Catechins are hydroxyflavans possessing a flavan-3-ol core (i.e. a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene-3-ol skeleton)
    and its substituted derivatives.

    This implementation uses a simplified SMARTS representing the flavan-3-ol core.
    The SMARTS (without stereochemical constraints) is defined as: 
        "c1ccc(c(c1))C2C(O)Oc3ccccc23"
    which represents a fused three-ring system: a phenyl (B ring) attached to a benzopyran system (A + C rings)
    carrying an â€“OH at the 3-position.

    To improve sensitivity and allow for substituted derivatives, we remove stereochemical annotations
    (which can vary among derivatives) before applying the match.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a catechin derivative, False otherwise
        str: Reason for classification
