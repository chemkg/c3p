def is_catechin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule belongs to the catechin class based on its SMILES string.
    Catechins are hydroxyflavans possessing a flavan-3-ol core (a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene-3-ol skeleton)
    and its substituted derivatives.
    
    To improve the detection (and allow for substituted derivatives or slight variations in saturation),
    we first remove all stereochemistry and then use a relaxed SMARTS for the catechin core.
    The relaxed SMARTS is defined as:
        "c1ccc(c(c1))C2CC(O)c3ccccc3O2"
    which represents a B ring (phenyl) attached to a chroman-like system carrying an â€“OH at the appropriate position.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if visible catechin core is detected, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
