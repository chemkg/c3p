Classifies: Acyl-CoA
Definition:
  An acyl-CoA is a thioester that results from condensation of the thiol group of Coenzyme A
  with the carboxy group of a fatty acid. Its structure features an acyl thioester group
  (C(=O)S) directly attached to a pantetheine moiety (which in our case may be recognized by
  either of two SMARTS patterns: "SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)" or "NCCSC(=O)") that in turn is connected
  (via a phosphate bridge) to an adenine-containing nucleotide.
Improvement:
  Instead of only testing for the mere presence of three independent fragments, we:
    1. Look for an acyl thioester group "[CX3](=O)[SX2]".
    2. Look for the pantetheine fragment using two possible patterns.
    3. Look for an adenine moiety "n1cnc2c(N)ncnc12".
    4. Verify that at least one thioester sulfur is either part of a pantetheine match or
       has a neighboring atom belonging to a pantetheine match.
    5. Check that at least one pantetheine match is connected (by a short path, â‰¤25 bonds)
       to the adenine moiety with at least one phosphorus atom in that connecting path.

def is_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):

    Determines if a molecule is an acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    The molecule must contain:
      1. An acyl thioester fragment: "[CX3](=O)[SX2]".
      2. A pantetheine fragment which we look for using two SMARTS:
         a) "SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)"
         b) "NCCSC(=O)"
      3. An adenine moiety: "n1cnc2c(N)ncnc12".
    In addition, we verify that:
      A. The sulfur in an acyl thioester is part of (or immediately adjacent to) at least one
         pantetheine match.
      B. At least one pantetheine match is connected to the adenine moiety by a short topological
         path (<=25 bonds) that includes at least one phosphorus (P) atom (i.e. representing a phosphate bridge).
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecular features are consistent with an acyl-CoA.
