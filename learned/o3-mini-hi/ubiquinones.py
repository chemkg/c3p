    """
    Determines if a molecule is a ubiquinone based on its SMILES string.
    Ubiquinones are defined as benzoquinones derived from 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone.
    They have a quinone ring (a cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione), with at least two methoxy substituents
    attached to the ring and usually a methyl group. Often, one substituent is a long polyprenyl chain.
