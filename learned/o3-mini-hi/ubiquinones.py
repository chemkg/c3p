Classifies: Ubiquinones – natural benzoquinones derived from 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone.
A valid ubiquinone must contain a redox‐active quinone core (cyclic diene-1,4-dione, as found by
the SMARTS "O=C1C=CC(=O)C=C1"). Substituents on the core are inspected as follows:
  • At least one oxygen substituent must be present that is either a simple methoxy (–OCH3)
    or a hydroxyl (–OH or deprotonated –O–) group.
  • In addition, there must be at least one alkyl substituent. Such a substituent, attached via a carbon,
    must be “simple” (i.e. acyclic, containing only carbon) and if it is long (≥5 carbons) it must contain at least one C=C.
  • No other substituents (e.g. halogens, heteroatoms, or aromatic rings) are allowed on the core.
Note: This algorithm is “best‐effort” and may fail on edge cases.
