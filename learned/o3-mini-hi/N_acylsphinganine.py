Classifies: N-acylsphinganine 
Definition: A ceramide consisting of sphinganine in which one of the amino hydrogens is substituted by a fatty acyl group.
This function attempts to identify such molecules by requiring a single acyl amide bond (C(=O)N)
and a sphinganine backbone (identified roughly by the substructure N[C@@H](CO)[C@H](O) or its alternative stereochemistry).
It also performs a simple check on the length of the fatty acyl chain.

def is_N_acylsphinganine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is N-acylsphinganine based on its SMILES string.
    
    The strategy is as follows:
     1. Parse the SMILES.
     2. Ensure there is exactly one amide bond (identified by the substructure C(=O)N).
     3. Check that the region adjacent to the nitrogen atom contains a sphinganine-like backbone,
        as identified by common substructure patterns (with stereochemical markers).
     4. Do a simple check that the acyl (fatty) chain attached via the carbonyl is long enough 
        (here we require at least 8 contiguous carbon atoms).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is N-acylsphinganine, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
