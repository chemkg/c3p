Classifies: N-acylsphinganine
Definition: A ceramide consisting of sphinganine in which one of the amino hydrogens is substituted by a fatty acyl group.
This implementation requires:
  1. Exactly one acyl amide bond (C(=O)N) in the molecule.
  2. The acyl carbon is attached to a fatty acyl chain (with at least 8 contiguous carbons).
  3. A sphinganine backbone is present. Here we require that one of two substructure patterns is found,
     with the acyl amide nitrogen as the beginning of the sphinganine backbone:
         - Pattern without substitution on the hydroxymethyl group: "N[C;H1](CO)[C;H1](O)"
         - Pattern allowing substitution of the hydroxymethyl group (e.g. glycosylation): "N[C;H1](CO[*])[C;H1](O)"
  4. The acyl amide N in the backbone must match the one found in the C(=O)N fragment.

def is_N_acylsphinganine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an N-acylsphinganine based on its SMILES string.
    
    Strategy:
      1. Parse the SMILES.
      2. Find exactly one acyl amide bond ("C(=O)N"); if not exactly one is found, fail.
      3. Starting from the acyl carbon (the carbonyl carbon), identify a fatty acyl chain â€“ using a breadth-first search to count contiguous carbon atoms.
      4. Look for a sphinganine backbone pattern beginning with the amide nitrogen. Two patterns are allowed:
             a. "N[C;H1](CO)[C;H1](O)" for an unsubstituted hydroxymethyl group.
             b. "N[C;H1](CO[*])[C;H1](O)" for a substituted version (e.g. glycosylated).
         In both cases the first atom (N) in the pattern should be the acyl amide nitrogen.
      5. If all tests pass, return True with an explanation.
    
    Args:
      smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
      
    Returns:
      bool: True if molecule qualifies as an N-acylsphinganine, False otherwise.
      str: Explanation detailing the decision.
