Classifies: CHEBI:36498 galactosylceramide
"""
"""
Classifies: Galactosylceramide â€“ any cerebroside with a galactose head group.
A galactosylceramide is a glycosphingolipid consisting of a ceramide (sphingoid base + fatty acid 
attached via an amide bond) linked to a monosaccharide that is galactose.

def is_galactosylceramide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a galactosylceramide based on its SMILES string.
    The algorithm looks for:
      1. A galactose-containing sugar ring (in beta-D configuration) as the head group.
      2. A ceramide motif (an amide bond linking a sphingoid base and a fatty acid chain).
      3. An overall molecular size consistent with glycosphingolipids.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a galactosylceramide, else False.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
