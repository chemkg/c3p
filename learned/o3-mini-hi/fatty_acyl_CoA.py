"""
Classifies: fatty acyl-CoA
Definition: An acyl-CoA results from the condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of a fatty acid.
The molecule must contain a thioester group (C(=O)S) linking an acyl chain on the carbonyl side to a CoA fragment.
We approximate the CoA fragment by requiring (a) at least one phosphorus (P) atom and (b) a purine (adenine) substructure.

def is_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if the given SMILES string corresponds to a fatty acyl-CoA.
    Our criteria:
      1. The SMILES must be valid.
      2. Contains a thioester group ([C;X3](=O)[S]).
      3. The thioester sulfur must be within 15 bonds of at least one phosphorus (P) atom.
      4. The carbonyl carbon of the thioester must lead to an aliphatic acyl chain (â‰¥3 contiguous non-aromatic carbons).
      5. The molecule must contain at least one purine (adenine) substructure, detected via several SMARTS variants.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule qualifies as a fatty acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
