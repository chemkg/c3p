    Determines if a molecule is a cardiolipin based on its SMILES string.
    Cardiolipin is defined as a phosphatidylglycerol composed of two molecules of phosphatidic acid
    covalently linked to a molecule of glycerol. In other words, cardiolipin has two phosphate groups,
    four acyl ester bonds and a glycerol linker in its headgroup.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a cardiolipin, False otherwise.
