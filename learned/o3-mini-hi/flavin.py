Classifies: A derivative of the dimethylisoalloxazine 
(7,8-dimethylbenzo[g]pteridine-2,4(3H,10H)-dione) skeleton

This version uses a refined SMARTS pattern that requires:
  - An aromatic benzene ring fused to the heterocyclic system with two explicit methyls,
  - Two keto groups on the heterocycle,
  - And the bridging (N10) nitrogen carries any non‚Äêhydrogen substituent,
as enforced by the [!H] specification.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavin derivative based on its SMILES string.
    A flavin is defined as a derivative of the dimethylisoalloxazine
    (7,8-dimethylbenzo[g]pteridine-2,4(3H,10H)-dione) skeleton with a substituent at the 10 position.
    We enforce that:
      - The isoalloxazine core is present,
      - The benzene ring shows two methyl groups (at positions analogous to 7 and 8),
      - And the bridging nitrogen (N10) has a substituent that is not hydrogen.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a flavin derivative, False otherwise.
        str: Reason explaining the classification result.
