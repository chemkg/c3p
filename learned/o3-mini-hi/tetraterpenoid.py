"""
Classifies: Tetraterpenoid
Definition: Any terpenoid derived from a tetraterpene. The term includes compounds in which the C40 skeleton 
of the parent tetraterpene has been rearranged or modified by the removal of one or more skeletal atoms.
Heuristic criteria (current version):
  1. Acceptable carbon count: between 20 and 120 carbon atoms.
  2. Molecular weight: between 200 and 2000 Da.
  3. Presence of an extended conjugated polyene chain: at least 3 consecutive conjugated double bonds.
     To detect this, we build a graph of atoms connected by conjugated double bonds and search for the longest
     simple path (measured as the number of bonds). This is to better cover stereochemical variants and avoid
     mis‚Äêdetection.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a tetraterpenoid based on its SMILES string using heuristic criteria.
    
    Heuristics:
      1. The molecule must contain between 20 and 120 carbon atoms.
      2. Its molecular weight must be between 200 and 2000 Da.
      3. The molecule must contain an extended conjugated polyene chain, defined here as a chain
         of at least three consecutive conjugated double bonds.
         We compute the longest such chain by building a graph of atoms linked by conjugated double bonds.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a tetraterpenoid by heuristic, False otherwise.
