Classifies: L-alpha-amino acid
Definition: Any alpha-amino acid having L-configuration at the alpha-carbon.
A free L-alpha-amino acid is defined here as a molecule with a free amino acid backbone,
i.e., an unmodified (non-amidated) amino group attached to a chiral alpha-carbon that bears
a protonated carboxylic acid group (-C(=O)O with an â€“OH), and with exactly one such backbone.
The alpha-carbon is assumed to have the CIP code "S" corresponding to the L configuration.

def is_L_alpha_amino_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a free L-alpha-amino acid based on its SMILES string.
    Checks for:
      1. A free amino group that is not amidated.
      2. A chiral alpha-carbon attached to a protonated carboxylic acid (C(=O)[O;H1]).
      3. Exactly one such amino acid backbone in the molecule (to avoid peptides).
      4. The alpha-carbon has a CIP code of "S" (i.e. L-configuration).
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a free L-alpha-amino acid, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the decision.
