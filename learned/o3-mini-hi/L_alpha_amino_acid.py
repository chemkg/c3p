"""
Classifies: L-alpha-amino acid
Definition: Any alpha-amino acid having L-configuration at the alpha-carbon.
An L-alpha-amino acid should contain a free amino acid backbone, i.e.,
a free amino group (not amidated) attached to a chiral alpha-carbon that bears
a carboxylic acid group (with an â€“OH), and the computed CIP code for that carbon should be "S".
We also require that exactly one such backbone is present (to avoid peptides).

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an L-alpha-amino acid based on its SMILES string.
    Checks for:
      1. A free amino group (i.e. not amidated)
      2. A chiral alpha-carbon attached to a carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) that is explicitly protonated (has an -OH).
      3. Exactly one such amino acid backbone (to avoid peptides).
      4. The alpha-carbon has a computed CIP code of "S" (by convention corresponding to L configuration).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a free L-alpha-amino acid, False otherwise.
