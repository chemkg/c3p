Classifies: Nonclassic icosanoid
Definition: Any biologically active signalling molecule made by oxygenation of C20 fatty acids
            other than the classic icosanoids (the leukotrienes and the prostanoids).
This function uses heuristic structural filters:
  - The molecule should have exactly 20 carbon atoms (i.e. derived from a C20 fatty acid).
  - The molecule should be oxygenated (have several oxygen atoms).
  - The molecule should have several unsaturations (double bonds) indicative of a polyunsaturated
    fatty acid.
  - To exclude prostanoids, we check for a cyclopentane ring (a 5-membered non‚Äêaromatic ring).
  - (Exclusion of leukotrienes by structure is challenging, so we rely on the above filters.)

def is_nonclassic_icosanoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nonclassic icosanoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    A nonclassic icosanoid is defined as an oxygenated derivative of a C20 fatty acid,
    excluding the classic icosanoids (leukotrienes and prostanoids). In our heuristic, the
    molecule must have 20 carbons, exhibit oxygenation and unsaturation typical for such a fatty
    acid derivative, and not contain a cyclopentane ring (a hallmark of prostanoids).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is judged to be a nonclassic icosanoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
