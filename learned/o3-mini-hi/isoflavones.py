def is_isoflavones(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule belongs to the isoflavones class based on its SMILES string.
    Isoflavones are defined as isoflavonoids containing a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one scaffold.
    
    Approach:
    1. Identify a benzopyran-4-one (chromen-4-one) core using a SMARTS pattern.
    2. Search from sp2 atoms of the core for an external aromatic substituent that
       is part of a six-membered aromatic ring (as expected for the typical 3-aryl substituent).
       
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an isoflavone, False otherwise.
        str: Reason explaining the classification decision.
