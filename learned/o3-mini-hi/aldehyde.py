"""
Classifies: Aldehyde â€“ a compound having the functional group RC(=O)H 
(where the carbonyl carbon is bonded to one hydrogen and one R group or, in the case of formaldehyde, two hydrogens).
The carbonyl group (C=O) must be exocyclic (i.e. not part of a ring) to avoid misclassifying lactones/esters.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldehyde based on its SMILES string.
    
    An aldehyde is defined as a compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O)
    in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to exactly one hydrogen and one R group 
    (or two hydrogens for formaldehyde). To avoid false positives from cyclic or lactone-type carbonyls,
    we require that the carbonyl double bond is exocyclic.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if at least one valid aldehyde group is found, False otherwise.
