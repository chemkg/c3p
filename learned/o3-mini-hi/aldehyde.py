def is_aldehyde(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldehyde based on its SMILES string.
    An aldehyde is defined as a compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O)
    in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to exactly one hydrogen and one R group,
    or in the case of formaldehyde, two hydrogens.
    
    We first add explicit hydrogens to ensure connectivity is reliable,
    then search for carbonyl carbons with the SMARTS "[CX3](=O)".
    For each candidate, we:
     1. Check that the carbon has exactly three neighbors.
     2. Identify the double-bonded oxygen (by checking for a bond order of 2).
     3. Check that the remaining two neighbors are either both hydrogens
        (formaldehyde) or one hydrogen and one non-oxygen (typical aldehyde).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if a valid aldehyde functional group is found, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the reasoning.
