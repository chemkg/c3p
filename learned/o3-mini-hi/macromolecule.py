"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33839 macromolecule
"""
"""
Improved classification for macromolecules.
Definition:
  "A macromolecule is a molecule of high relative molecular mass, 
   the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple repetition 
   of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass."

Heuristic improvements:
  1. We count unique occurrences of amide bonds and sugar-like rings
     (using non-overlapping substructure matches).
  2. We apply thresholds that vary with the molecular weight range and total atom count:
         - For weight â‰¥ 1000 Da: require at least 2 repeating units and at least 40 atoms.
         - For weight between 800 and 1000 Da: require at least 3 repeating units and at least 50 atoms.
         - For weight between 500 and 800 Da: require at least 4 repeating units and at least 60 atoms.
         - Otherwise, classify as not macromolecular.
Usage:
  Call is_macromolecule(smiles) to get a boolean result plus an explanation.
