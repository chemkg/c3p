Classifies: CDP-diacylglycerol
Definition: A CDP-glycerol having unspecified acyl groups (most commonly fatty acyl groups) at the 1- and 2-positions.
Improved heuristics:
  - Check for a cytidine moiety using a SMARTS pattern.
  - Require a strict diacylglycerol fragmentâ€”with two acyl ester groups on a three-carbon glycerol backbone 
    (i.e. CH2(OC(=O)[#6])-[CH](OC(=O)[#6])-[CH2]OP).
  - Verify diphosphate connectivity, meaning two phosphorus atoms connected via a bridging oxygen.

def is_CDP_diacylglycerol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a CDP-diacylglycerol based on its SMILES string.
    
    The heuristic criteria are as follows:
      1. The molecule must contain a cytidine moiety, captured by the SMARTS "n1ccc(N)nc1=O".
      2. The molecule must have a diacylglycerol fragment that looks like:
         CH2(OC(=O)[#6])-[CH](OC(=O)[#6])-[CH2]OP
         which represents a glycerol backbone where positions 1 and 2 are acylated (esterified) 
         and the third carbon is linked (via an O) to a phosphate.
      3. The molecule must exhibit diphosphate connectivity; that is, two phosphorus atoms (atomic number 15)
         that are bridged by an oxygen.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a CDP-diacylglycerol, False otherwise.
        str: A message explaining the reasoning behind the classification.
