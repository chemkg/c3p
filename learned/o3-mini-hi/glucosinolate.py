Classifies: Glucosinolate
Definition: Water-soluble anionic substituted thioglucosides.
Glucosinolates have a central C atom which is bonded via an S atom to a glycone group
and via an N atom to a sulfonated oxime group, and which also carries a side‚Äêgroup.
The side-chain and sulfate group have an anti stereochemical configuration across the C=N double bond.
(Note: The anti configuration is not explicitly verified.)

def is_glucosinolate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a glucosinolate based on its SMILES string.

    Strategy:
      1. Look for a sulfonated oxime group. Our modified SMARTS pattern now expects:
         a carbon double bonded to an N that is connected to an O which in turn
         is bonded to an S and two oxygens in a sulfonyl moiety.
         SMARTS: "C(=N[O]S(=O)(=O)[O-]?)" (the charge on the terminal O is optional).
      2. Verify that the central carbon (the one in the oxime) has at least three substituents.
      3. From the central carbon, find a neighbor sulfur atom that is not the sulfonyl S
         (i.e. not the one coming from the oxime match).
      4. For that candidate sulfur, search its neighbors (ignoring the central carbon)
         to see if one of them is part of a sugar (glycone) ring.
         We use a relaxed SMARTS for a pyranose ring: "C1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)"
         and ignore chirality.
      5. If a match is found, return True with an explanation.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as glucosinolate, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
