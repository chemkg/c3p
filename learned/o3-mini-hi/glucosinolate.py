Classifies: CHEBI:24279 glucosinolate

Classifies: Glucosinolate
Definition: Water-soluble anionic substituted thioglucosides.
Glucosinolates have a central C atom which is bonded via an S atom to a glycone group
and via an N atom to a sulfonated oxime group, and which also carries a side‚Äêgroup.
The side-chain and sulfate group have an anti stereochemical configuration across the C=N double bond.
(Note: The anti configuration is not explicitly verified.)

def is_glucosinolate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a glucosinolate based on its SMILES string.
    
    Strategy:
      1. Look for a sulfonated oxime fragment. In our SMARTS, we expect a pattern:
         central carbon double-bonded to nitrogen, which is bonded to an oxygen that is linked
         to a sulfonyl group; i.e. "C(=N[O]S(=O)(=O)[O-]?)". This pattern is designed to capture the
         oxime fragment while allowing an optional negative charge.
      2. For each oxime match we examine the identified central carbon (match[0]). This carbon should
         have at least three substituents (to allow a side-chain).
      3. Among its neighbors, find a sulfur atom that is not the sulfonyl sulfur already in the oxime match.
      4. For that candidate sulfur, check whether one of its neighbors (other than the central C)
         is part of a glycone (sugar) ring. We use a standard pyranose pattern: "C1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)"
         (ignoring chirality).
      5. If all criteria are met, the molecule is classified as a glucosinolate.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a glucosinolate, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
