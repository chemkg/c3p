"""
Classifies: Inositol Phosphoceramide
Definition: A phosphosphingolipid in which an inositol residue and the ceramide moiety are linked via a phosphodiester bridge.
The ceramide moiety contains substituents (typically an amide bond and long aliphatic chains).
In this implementation:
  - A strict SMARTS pattern is used to capture a cyclohexane bearing an OH on every carbon.
  - We locate the unique inositol ring and record its atom indices.
  - We collect all matches for an amide bond (C(=O)N) and record the carbonyl carbons.
  - For every phosphorus atom, we inspect its bonds: it must have at least one double‚Äêbonded oxygen (P=O) and two single-bonded oxygen neighbors.
    One of these oxygens must connect to an inositol atom and another must be bonded to one of the amide carbonyl carbons.
  - We also require the overall molecule to have a minimum molecular weight and number of carbons.

def is_inositol_phosphoceramide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an inositol phosphoceramide based on its SMILES string.
    
    The method checks:
      1) The presence of an inositol ring substructure: a cyclohexane that carries an OH on each carbon.
      2) A phosphodiester linkage in which a phosphorus atom is connected via oxygen to both the inositol and
         to a ceramide moiety (the latter being indicated by the presence of an amide bond, C(=O)N).
      3) Sufficient overall molecular size.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an inositol phosphoceramide, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the classification decision.
