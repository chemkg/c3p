Classifies: Polyamine
Definition: Any organic amino compound that contains two or more amino groups.
A polyamine is here detected by:
  1. Rejecting molecules that look peptide-like (>=2 amide bonds in a >10 heavy atom molecule).
  2. Adding explicit hydrogens and then inspecting every nitrogen.
  3. For each nitrogen, excluding quaternary centers and (for aromatic nitrogens) those lacking an â€“NH.
  4. Also flagging nitrogen involved in an amide bond (if attached to a carbon that is double-bonded to oxygen).
  5. Finally, checking that at least two candidate amino groups exist and that at least one pair is sufficiently separated in the bond network.
This heuristic uses RDKit.

def is_polyamine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polyamine based on its SMILES string.
    A polyamine is defined as any organic amino compound that contains two or more amino groups.
    
    The function first flags molecules that look peptide-like (>=2 amide bonds in a reasonably sized molecule)
    and returns False if so. Then it adds explicit hydrogens and inspects every nitrogen.
    
    For each nitrogen:
      - If it is directly attached (via a double bond) to a carbonyl carbon, we flag it as being in an amide.
      - Exclude quaternary nitrogens (degree >=4).
      - For aromatic nitrogen, count only if it has one or more hydrogens attached.
      - For non-aromatic nitrogens, simply count them.
    
    Finally, if at least two candidate amino groups are found, the code checks if at least one pair is separated
    by a bond path of at least 3 (using the full bond graph). For molecules in which every heavy atom is in a ring,
    a less strict requirement is applied provided the molecule is not extremely small.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a polyamine, False otherwise.
        str: A reason explaining the result.
