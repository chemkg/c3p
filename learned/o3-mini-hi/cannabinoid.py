Classifies: CHEBI:67194 cannabinoid

"""
Classifies: Cannabinoid class
Definition:
  "A diverse group of pharmacologically active secondary metabolite characteristic to Cannabis plant 
   as well as produced naturally in the body by humans and animals. Cannabinoids contain oxygen as a 
   part of the heterocyclic ring or in the form of various functional groups."
   
Heuristic rules used in this improved version:
  1. Molecule must be a valid structure with at least one oxygen and a molecular weight above a minimum (e.g., 200 Da).
  2. Molecules with phosphorus (or similar non-cannabinoid markers) are excluded.
  3. If the molecule contains an aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group (phenol), then it is likely a phytocannabinoid.
  4. Alternatively, if the molecule contains an amide or ester functionality and features a sufficiently long aliphatic (carbon) chain 
     (using a DFS search to compute longest chain; here a chain of at least 8 carbons is required), it is classified as an endocannabinoid.
  5. As a last resort, if the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring (ring of at least 5 atoms) containing oxygen, then it might be cannabinoid-related.
     
If none of these rules apply, then the molecule is not classified as a cannabinoid.

def is_cannabinoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a cannabinoid based on selected heuristics.
    
    Approach:
      - Validate the molecule and ensure it contains oxygen and avoids elements like phosphorus.
      - If the molecule is too small (low molecular weight), rule it out.
      - If an aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group (phenol) is found, assume the molecule is a phytocannabinoid.
      - Alternatively, if an amide or ester functionality exists together with a long aliphatic chain (longest Câ€“chain length >= 8),
        then assume it is an endocannabinoid.
      - Otherwise, if any heterocyclic ring (ring of >=5 atoms that contains oxygen) is found, then return a positive classification.
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a cannabinoid, False otherwise.
