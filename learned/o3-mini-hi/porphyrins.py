def is_porphyrins(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a porphyrin based on its SMILES string.
    A porphyrin is defined as a natural pigment whose core structure consists of
    four pyrrole-like units (aromatic rings of size 5 or 6 with exactly one nitrogen)
    united via four methine (carbon) bridges.
    
    This heuristic:
      1. Uses GetSymmSSSR() to obtain all rings.
      2. Selects candidate rings that are aromatic, of size 5 or 6, and contain exactly one nitrogen.
      3. Constructs a connectivity graph among candidate rings: two rings are connected if they share
         exactly one atom, and that atom is a carbon.
      4. Searches for any 4 candidate rings that form a cycle (each ring connected to exactly two others 
         within the set, forming the fused porphyrin core).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a porphyrin, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
