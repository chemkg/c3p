Classifies: 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-)

Definition:
 An acyl-CoA(4-) oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups 
 of any 3-substituted propionyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3.

This implementation now checks:
 1. That the net formal charge is exactly –4.
 2. That the adenine moiety (the CoA headgroup) is present.
 3. That the characteristic CoA connector (pantetheine fragment) is found – here using the SMARTS:
      "SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)C(O)C(C)(C)COP"
 4. That a thioester linkage (pattern "[#6](=O)S") is present and that the sulfur in that linkage is 
    embedded within one of the CoA connector matches.
 5. That the acyl chain attached to the thioester carbonyl (that is not part of the CoA scaffold) 
    is made entirely of carbon atoms and is linear (no branching).
If any test fails, the molecule is not classified as a member of the 3‐substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) class.

    """
    Determines if a molecule matches the class of 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) based on its SMILES string.
    
    Expected criteria:
      - Net formal charge exactly -4.
      - The characteristic adenine moiety is present.
      - A composite CoA connector is present (SMARTS: "SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)C(O)C(C)(C)COP").
      - A thioester linkage ([#6](=O)S) is found and its sulfur belongs to the above connector.
      - The acyl chain attached at the thioester carbonyl is composed solely of carbon atoms and is linear (no branches).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string for the molecule.
    
    Returns:
