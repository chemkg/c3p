"""
Classifies: A hopanoid is defined as a triterpenoid based on a hopane skeleton.
This program uses a Murcko scaffold to try to capture a fused polycyclic core 
that should have roughly 30 carbons (hopane has C30) and at least 5 rings.
Note: This is a heuristic approach and may not classify every hopanoid correctly.

def is_hopanoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a hopanoid based on its SMILES string.
    A hopanoid is defined as a triterpenoid based on a hopane skeleton.
    The approach here extracts the molecule's Murcko scaffold, then checks:
      - The number of carbons in the scaffold (should be roughly that of the hopane core, ~30)
      - That the scaffold contains at least 5 rings (consistent with a pentacyclic hopane skeleton)
      - A sanity check that the overall molecule contains enough carbons 
        (suggesting it is indeed a triterpenoid).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a hopanoid, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
