"""
Classifies: Polychlorobiphenyl
Definition: A biphenyl compound containing between 2 and 10 chlorine atoms attached (exclusively) as substituents on the two benzene rings.
The improved approach identifies the biphenyl core and then verifies that every substituent on that core is chlorine.

def is_polychlorobiphenyl(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polychlorobiphenyl based on its SMILES string.
    
    The function looks for a biphenyl scaffold built from two benzene rings connected by a single bond.
    For each candidate biphenyl core match, we examine the atoms directly attached to the core.
    Only chlorine substituents (atomic number 17) are allowed; any additional substituents lead to rejection.
    The candidate is accepted only if the number of chlorine substituents directly attached to the biphenyl core 
    is between 2 and 10 (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule meets the criteria, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
