Classifies: CHEBI:192499 anthoxanthin
"""
"""
Classifies: Anthoxanthin â€“ flavonoid pigments in plants that are typically based on a flavone (2-phenylchromen-4-one) scaffold,
although extensive substitution (e.g., methoxylation, hydroxylation, glycosylation) is common.
The new approach uses revised SMARTS that focus on the core connectivity of a flavone while allowing substituents.

def is_anthoxanthin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an anthoxanthin (a flavonoid pigment) based on its SMILES string.
    Here we search for a flavone (2-phenylchromen-4-one) core, taking into account substituent tolerance.
    
    We use two SMARTS patterns which represent the core connectivity of the flavone skeleton:
      Pattern 1: "c1ccc(-c2oc(=O)c3ccccc3c2)cc1"
      Pattern 2: "c1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3occcc3c2)cc1"
    
    These patterns capture the two typical ways in which the 2-phenylchromen-4-one core is drawn.
    If either is found as a substructure, we classify the molecule as an anthoxanthin.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as anthoxanthin, False otherwise.
