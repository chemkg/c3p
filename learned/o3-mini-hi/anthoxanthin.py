"""
Classifies: CHEBI:192499 anthoxanthin
"""
"""
Classifies: Anthoxanthin â€“ flavonoid pigments in plants that range in color from colorless/creamy to yellow.
Anthoxanthins are generally based on a flavone (2-phenylchromen-4-one) scaffold, although substitutions
may lead to variations in the drawn structure.
The program uses two SMARTS patterns to capture the typical flavone core connectivity.

    Determines if a molecule is an anthoxanthin (a flavonoid pigment) based on its SMILES string.
    We search for a flavone (2-phenylchromen-4-one) core, but because of connectivity variations due
