Classifies: CHEBI:86315 methyl sulfide
"""
"""
Classifies: Methyl sulfide
Definition: Any aliphatic sulfide (thioether) in which at least one of the 
organyl groups attached to the sulfur is a methyl group.
In this implementation we require that the S atom:
  1. Has exactly two neighbors and all bonds are single.
  2. Has at least one CH3 substituent (i.e. a carbon atom with only three hydrogens).
Additionally, to avoid flagging large biomolecules where a â€“SCH3 is only part 
of a side chain, we check for the presence of multiple amide bonds (a rough proxy
for peptides or similar molecules). If two or more amide bonds are found, the candidate
will be rejected.

def is_methyl_sulfide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a methyl sulfide according to the following rules:
      - The molecule must contain at least one sulfur atom (atomic number 16)
        that is involved only in single bonds and has exactly two heavy-atom neighbors.
      - Among its two neighbors, at least one must be a methyl group 
        (a carbon atom with Degree==1 and exactly three explicitly attached hydrogens).
      - To avoid flagging peptides or nucleosides (where a methylthio group is
        only a side-chain) we count amide bonds ([NX3][CX3](=O)). If 2 or more are found,
        we assume the molecule is not primarily a methyl sulfide.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a methyl sulfide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
