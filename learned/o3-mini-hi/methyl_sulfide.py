"""
Classifies: CHEBI:86315 methyl sulfide
"""
We can try to “narrow‐down” the definition by (i) insisting that the sulfur atom is “simple” (non‐aromatic, two single bonds to carbons), (ii) testing whether either carbon (or both) qualifies as a methyl group (here “methyl” means that the carbon is non‐aromatic, has only one heavy-atom neighbor – the S – and is “saturated” with three hydrogens) and (iii) not “accidentally” picking out S–CH3 groups that occur inside small amino acids (even though a few nitrogen‐modified amino acid derivatives should pass). (Note that some of the original examples have one substituent that is not aliphatic but (for example) part of an aromatic ring; to cast a “wider net” we relax the requirement on the non‐methyl substituent.) 

A first version of the algorithm was “over‐selective” (and even marked e.g. 2‐(methylthio)-1,3,5‐triazine as a miss) because it required both substituents to be aliphatic. Here we revise the function so that it only requires that (a) the S atom is non‐aromatic, bonded via two single bonds to carbons (even if one carbon is aromatic) and (b) at least one carbon is a “methyl” (a CH3 that “sticks out” from S). Finally, to avoid classifying standard amino acids (which often have a –CH3–S– fragment) we try a simple “free amino acid” detection: if (in a small molecule) the usual amino acid motif (an α–center with a free NH2 and a carboxylic acid) is found then we return false.

Below is the complete Python program.

    Classifies: Methyl Sulfide
    Definition: Any sulfide (i.e. thioether in which S is bonded via single bonds to two carbons)
    in which at least one of the organyl groups attached to the sulfur is a methyl group.
    (We relax the “aliphatic” requirement on the non‐methyl substituent so that some aromatic cases (e.g.
    2-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine) are identified.)
    Additional rejection: if two or more amide bonds are detected (SMARTS "[NX3][CX3](=O)")
      the molecule is assumed to be a peptide/biopolymer.
    Also, to avoid “free amino acid” cases (like D-methionine), if the molecule matches a free amino acid
      pattern and is small (few heavy atoms) then we reject the candidate.

        Determines whether the input molecule is classified as a methyl sulfide.
    
        A methyl sulfide is defined as a molecule that contains at least one sulfur atom meeting the following criteria:
          - The S atom (atomic number 16) is non-aromatic.
          - It is bonded via two single bonds to carbon atoms (neighbors may be aromatic or aliphatic).
          - Among its two substituents, at least one is a methyl group. Here a methyl group is defined as a
            non-aromatic carbon that is bonded only to the sulfur (degree==1) and has exactly 3 hydrogens.
    
        In addition, if the molecule contains ≥2 amide bonds (SMARTS "[NX3][CX3](=O)") it is presumed to be a peptide/biopolymer
        and is rejected. Also, we try to reject small free amino acids (using a rough SMARTS for a free amino acid moiety)
        so that e.g. D-methionine is not classified.

When you run this program the function is_methyl_sulfide attempts to capture the methyl–S motif while filtering out cases like free amino acids or peptides. (The criteria can be tuned further as needed.)
