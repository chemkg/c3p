"""
Classifies: CHEBI:28765 phosphatidylinositol phosphate
"""
"""
Classifies: Phosphatidylinositol phosphate (a phosphoinositide, one of seven naturally occurring).
A phosphatidylinositol phosphate is expected to contain:
  - A (myo-)inositol head group (a six-membered ring with several hydroxyl groups),
  - A phosphate ester linking the inositol to a glycerol backbone,
  - At least two long-chain acyl groups attached as esters (forming the diacylglycerol part).

This program is an approximate classifier that uses chemical substructure matching via RDKit.

    Determines if a molecule is a phosphatidylinositol phosphate based on its SMILES string.
