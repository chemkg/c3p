"""
Classifies: polypyrrole
Definition: A compound composed of two or more pyrrole units.
A pyrrole unit is defined as a five‚Äêmembered aromatic ring containing exactly one nitrogen.
In our improved classifier we not only count pyrrole matches (via SMARTS) but also
require that (a) at least two pyrrole units appear in the same connected substructure and
(b) that the atoms of that cluster form at least 15% of the heavy atoms in the molecule.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polypyrrole based on its SMILES string.
    
    A polypyrrole is defined as a compound composed of two or more pyrrole units.
    Here a pyrrole unit is detected by a SMARTS pattern for a five-membered aromatic ring
    containing one nitrogen and four carbons. In addition,
    we require that at least two such pyrrole rings are connected (either directly or via adjacent rings)
    and that the combined pyrrole cluster represents a reasonable fraction of the heavy atoms.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a polypyrrole, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
