Classifies: CHEBI:10036 wax ester

"""
Classifies: Wax ester â€“ defined as a fatty acid ester resulting from the condensation 
of the carboxy group of a fatty acid with the alcoholic hydroxy group of a fatty alcohol.
This improved version ensures the molecule contains only C and O, that exactly one candidate ester bond
splits the molecule into two acyclic (linear), unfunctionalized aliphatic fragments, 
with the fatty acid fragment having >=12 aliphatic C, and the fatty alcohol fragment having >=8 aliphatic C.

def is_wax_ester(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a wax ester based on its SMILES string.
    A wax ester is produced by the condensation of a fatty acid (providing the carbonyl)
    with a fatty alcohol. The algorithm requires that the entire molecule consists only of carbon and oxygen,
    that at least one candidate ester bond (after deduplication) produces exactly two fragments,
    both of which are acyclic and unfunctionalized aliphatic fragments. The fragment containing a carbonyl
    must have at least 12 aliphatic carbons (fatty acid) and the other at least 8 (fatty alcohol).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a wax ester, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
