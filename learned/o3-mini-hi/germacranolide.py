    Determines if a molecule is a germacranolide based on its SMILES string.
    Germacranolides are sesquiterpene lactones that have (1) a lactone ring (cyclic ester)
    and (2) a germacrane skeleton, defined by a 10-membered (mostly carbon) ring.

        bool: True if molecule is classified as a germacranolide, False otherwise.
