Classifies: alditol
Alditols are acyclic polyols having the general formula HOCH2[CH(OH)]nCH2OH 
(formally derivable from an aldose by reduction of the carbonyl group).
This script looks for a contiguous carbon chain where the end carbons
appear as primary alcohols (CH2OH) and the interior carbons as secondary alcohols (CH(OH)).

def is_alditol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an alditol based on its SMILES string.
    An alditol is defined as an acyclic polyol with the general pattern
    HOCH2[CH(OH)]nCH2OH (reduction product of an aldose).
    
    This routine first adds explicit hydrogens so that -OH groups are detectable.
    It then finds carbons that bear at least one hydroxyl group. From these,
    it looks for a connected subgraph (chain) that is linear: two terminal carbons
    (primary alcohols, expected to have two bound hydrogens) and interior carbons
    (secondary alcohols, expected to have one hydrogen).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as alditol, False otherwise.
        str : Reason for classification.
