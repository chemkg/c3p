Classifies: Glycosphingolipid
A glycosphingolipid is defined as a glycolipid that is a carbohydrate‚Äêcontaining derivative 
of a sphingoid or ceramide, with the carbohydrate residue attached by a glycosidic linkage 
to O-1 of the sphingoid.

def is_glycosphingolipid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a glycosphingolipid based on its SMILES string.
    
    Our heuristic strategy is:
      1. Identify a carbohydrate ring by iterating over all rings and flagging those 
         that are five- or six-membered and contain exactly one oxygen atom.
      2. Identify a sphingoid/ceramide backbone by detecting a fragment 
         "C(=O)NC(CO)" which heuristically captures many ceramide-like motifs.
      3. Verify that one of the sugar rings is connected via an exocyclic oxygen 
         (i.e. a glycosidic linkage) to the sphingoid fragment.
         
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a glycosphingolipid, False otherwise.
        str: A reason explaining the classification.
