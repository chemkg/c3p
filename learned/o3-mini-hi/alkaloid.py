Classifies: Alkaloid

Definition:
    Alkaloids are naturally occurring, basic nitrogen compounds,
    usually containing one or more heterocyclic rings. They are
    primarily found in the plant kingdom (and also in bacteria,
    fungi, and animals). In contrast, compounds in which the nitrogen
    is exclusively exocyclic (such as dopamine, mescaline, serotonin, etc.)
    are generally classed as amines rather than alkaloids.
    
This function uses a simple heuristic:
  1. It verifies that the input SMILES can be converted to an RDKit molecule.
  2. It checks that the molecule contains at least one nitrogen atom.
  3. It inspects all nitrogen atoms to see if at least one is part of a ring.
If a nitrogen is found as part of a ring then the molecule is flagged as a potential alkaloid.
Otherwise, it is not classified as an alkaloid.

def is_alkaloid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an alkaloid based on its SMILES string using a heuristic.
    
    An alkaloid (by our heuristic) is defined as a naturally occurring, basic nitrogen compound 
    that contains at least one nitrogen atom incorporated into a ring system (heterocycle).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an alkaloid, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the classification reasoning.
