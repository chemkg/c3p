"""
Classifies: butyrate ester
Definition: Any carboxylic ester where the carboxylic acid component is butyric acid.
This means that one of the ester groups in the molecule has an acyl part corresponding to n-butyrate:
CH3CH2CH2COO-
We improve upon previous attempts by using a SMARTS pattern that ensures the ester oxygen is non‚Äêprotic.
