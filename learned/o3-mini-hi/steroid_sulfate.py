Classifies: steroid sulfate
Definition: A sulfuric ester obtained by the formal condensation of a hydroxy group of any steroid with sulfuric acid.
A valid steroid sulfate must have a sulfate ester group (in anionic or neutral form)
that is attached (directly or via one intervening saturated atom) to a steroid nucleus.
Heuristic for a steroid nucleus: a fused polycyclic system with at least 4 rings,
including at least one 5-membered and three 6-membered rings.

def is_steroid_sulfate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a steroid sulfate based on its SMILES string.
    
    Steps:
    1. Look for sulfate ester group (either anionic or neutral).
    2. Identify a steroid nucleus via a fused group of rings:
       - at least four rings,
       - at least one 5-membered and three 6-membered rings.
    3. Verify that one sulfate esterâ€™s "attachment oxygen" (i.e. the oxygen from the -OH that underwent condensation)
       is connected (directly or via one intervening sp3 saturated atom) to an atom that is part of the steroid nucleus.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a steroid sulfate; False otherwise.
