def is_steroid_sulfate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a steroid sulfate based on its SMILES string.
    
    The classification is based on two criteria:
    1. The presence of a sulfate ester group (â€“OS(=O)(=O)O, or its ionic form).
    2. The presence of a steroid nucleus, which we heuristically define as a set of
       at least four fused rings (usually three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring)
       that are interconnected. Additionally, one of the sulfate groups should be attached
       to one of the atoms within that fused ring system (i.e. the steroid framework).
       
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a steroid sulfate; False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
