Classifies: CHEBI: 1-monoglyceride
Definition: A monoglyceride in which the acyl substituent is located at a primary position (i.e. at position 1 or equivalently 3)
This improved version:
  1. Parses the SMILES string.
  2. Excludes molecules that contain phosphorus.
  3. Requires exactly one ester group (using the SMARTS "[CX3](=O)O").
  4. Searches for a glycerol backbone with the ester at a primary (terminal) CH2;
     we define two patterns â€“ one with the acyl substitution at the first carbon and one with it at the third.
     In these SMARTS the backbone carbons are explicitly labeled (using :1, :2, :3).
  5. Checks that the three backbone atoms are not part of any ring (to reduce false positives).
  6. Requires a minimal molecular weight (100 Da).
This heuristic approach improves specificity by verifying that the glycerol backbone appears as a freely hanging (acyclic) unit.
