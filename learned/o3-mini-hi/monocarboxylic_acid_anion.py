    Determines if a molecule is a monocarboxylic acid anion based on its SMILES string.
    
    A monocarboxylic acid anion is defined as a molecule forming from a monocarboxylic acid upon the
    loss of its acidic proton â€“ in structure, it should contain exactly one carboxylate group, i.e., a 
    carbonyl (C=O) directly bonded to an anionic oxygen [O-].

        (bool, str): A tuple where the first element is True if the molecule is a monocarboxylic acid anion,
                     False otherwise, and the second element is a string that provides the reasoning for the result.
