def is_aldopentose(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldopentose based on its SMILES string.
    An aldopentose is a five‚Äêcarbon sugar that either shows an aldehyde group in the open-chain form 
    or exists in a cyclic form (hemiacetal) capable of generating an aldehyde upon ring opening.
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is an aldopentose, False otherwise.
