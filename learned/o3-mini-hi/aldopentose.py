Classifies: CHEBI:33916 aldopentose
"""
"""
Classifies: aldopentose, defined as 'A pentose with a (potential) aldehyde group at one end.'
This function checks that the molecule has exactly 5 carbons and 5 oxygens
(consistent with an aldopentose formula, C5H10O5) and then determines whether it is in
the open-chain or cyclized (hemiacetal) form. In the open-chain form, an aldehyde group is
expected at a terminal carbon; in the cyclic form (without lactone functionality) the molecule
is assumed to be in equilibrium with the open‚Äêchain form.

def is_aldopentose(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldopentose based on its SMILES string.
    
    An aldopentose is a 5-carbon sugar (typically C5H10O5) that in its open-chain form displays
    an aldehyde group at one terminal carbon. In its cyclic (hemiacetal) form the aldehyde may not
    be explicit, but the molecule still has 5 carbons in its sugar backbone.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an aldopentose; False otherwise.
