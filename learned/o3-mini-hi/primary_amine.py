Classifies: Primary amine
A primary amine is defined as a compound formally derived from ammonia (NH3)
by replacing one hydrogen atom with a hydrocarbyl group (i.e. Râ€“NH2).

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a primary amine based on its SMILES string.
    A primary amine should contain at least one nitrogen atom that is bonded
    to exactly one non-hydrogen (preferably a carbon) substituent and two hydrogens.
    Amide nitrogen atoms (bonded to C=O) are not considered primary amines.
