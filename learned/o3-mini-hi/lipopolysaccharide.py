Classifies: Lipopolysaccharide

Definition:
    Lipopolysaccharides are natural compounds consisting of a trisaccharide repeating unit 
    (two heptose units and octulosonic acid) with oligosaccharide side chains and 
    3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid units. They are a major constituent of the cell walls
    of Gram-negative bacteria.

Heuristic criteria used in this classifier:
  - At least one sugar-like ring is detected (rings of size 5â€“7 atoms that contain at least one oxygen and mostly carbons).
  - Presence of a carboxyl/carboxylic acid or ester motif is required. We look for a carbonyl bound to an oxygen ([CX3](=O)[OX2]).
  - Presence of a long aliphatic chain is expected. To capture this we look for at least eight contiguous carbon atoms 
    (as a proxy for at least 8 CH2 groups) using the SMARTS "CCCCCCCC".
  - Overall molecular weight is expected to be >1000 Da.

Note:
  This is a heuristic approach and some lipopolysaccharides may not meet all of these criteria perfectly.
