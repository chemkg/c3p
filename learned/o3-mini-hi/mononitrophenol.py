Classifies: mononitrophenol
Definition: A mononitrophenol is defined as a phenol (an aromatic benzene ring with a single -OH substituent)
carrying exactly one nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) attached to the ring.
This updated approach requires that the ring is a 6-membered (benzene) ring having exactly one â€“OH (or its deprotonated form)
attached and one nitro group bonded to one of its carbons.

def is_mononitrophenol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a mononitrophenol based on its SMILES string.
    
    A mononitrophenol must:
      1. Contain exactly one nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]).
      2. Have that nitro group attached to an aromatic (benzene) ring.
      3. The benzene ring must carry exactly one hydroxyl substituent (as -OH or deprotonated -O-)
         attached directly to a ring carbon. This is used as a proxy for a phenol.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a mononitrophenol, False otherwise.
