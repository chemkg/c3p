"""
Classifies: polyphenol
Defined as: members of the class of phenols that contain 2 or more benzene rings,
each of which is substituted by at least one hydroxy group.
Here the approach is to first detect 6-membered rings made entirely of aromatic carbons
(i.e. benzene rings). Then for each ring we check whether at least one carbon is bonded
to an oxygen which is not involved in a carbonyl (i.e. C=O) and not linked to a sulfur (avoiding sulfate).
This heuristic is designed so that even if the oxygen is further elaborated (eg glycosylated),
it is counted while excluding Oâ€“ in esters or sulfates.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polyphenol (per the definition above).
    We require that the molecule contains at least 2 benzene rings (6-membered aromatic C rings)
    and that each such ring has at least one oxygen substituent that is not directly involved
    in a carbonyl or sulfate group.
