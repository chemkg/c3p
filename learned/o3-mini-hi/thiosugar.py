Classifies: Thiosugar

A thiosugar is defined as a carbohydrate derivative in which one or more of the oxygens
or hydroxy groups of the parent carbohydrate is replaced by sulfur or -SR.

The algorithm first searches for sugar rings (5- or 6-membered rings) that have
(sugar-like) external hydroxyl substituents. If such a ring is found,
either (A) its intrinsic heteroatom is S or (B) one of its ring carbons bears a simple S substituent.
If no ring candidate is found, it does an open-chain search for a contiguous chain of carbons (4-6)
that has predominantly oxygen substituents and at least one sulfur substituent.
