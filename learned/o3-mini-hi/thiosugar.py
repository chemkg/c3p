def is_thiosugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a thiosugar based on its SMILES string.
    The function first searches for sugar ring motifs (pyranose and furanose rings) â€“ these
    are defined by rings containing one heteroatom (usually oxygen) and the remaining carbons. 
    It then examines whether any of the positions that normally are oxygen or hydroxyl groups have been
    replaced by sulfur.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a thiosugar, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
