"""
Classifies: CHEBI:73754 thiosugar
"""
Below is one possible improved solution. In our reasoning we first noted that the earlier attempt simply “matched‐a sugar ring” using generic SMARTS (which even mistakenly used the same pattern for furanoses and pyranoses) and then looked for any sulfur attached to a ring carbon. (1) This approach flagged many glucosinolates as thiosugars because in those compounds the sugar ring is “normal” and the S is part of the linkage that is not actually replacing an –OH. (2) Also, an open‐chain carbohydrate such as 1‑(methylthio)ribulose 5‑phosphate was missed because no ring was detected. 

In the new code we try to improve along two lines. First we identify candidate sugar “moieties” by using the ring information (rings of size 5 or 6 whose atoms are mainly carbons plus exactly one heteroatom, which we expect to be O in a “normal” carbohydrate). Then for each candidate ring we check two possible ways for a thiosugar to appear:
 • either the ring is “modified” itself (i.e. the one heteroatom is S instead of O) 
 • or one of the carbons expected (based on typical sugars) to hold a hydroxyl substituent instead carries a sulfur atom.
In order to avoid mis‐classifying glucosinolates – whose sugar part is intact and which bear a sulfur atom as part of a linkage group – we check for characteristic extra connectivity (for example, if the sulfur “extra” is linked to a carbon that is doubly bonded to oxygen, we assume it is part of a –C(=N…)-type fragment and not a thio “replacement” for –OH). Finally, if no ring candidate is found, we try a very simple open‐chain search (by scanning for a short chain that may represent an aldose or ketose where one of the expected hydroxyl groups is replaced by sulfur).

One may certainly debate the rules used (and even the gold‐standard “answer” is tricky). In the code below we implement one version. (If the task is too ambiguous the function may return (None, None).)

Below is the complete Python code:

------------------------------------------------

from rdkit import Chem

def is_thiosugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a thiosugar based on its SMILES string.
    A thiosugar is defined as a carbohydrate derivative in which one or more
    of the oxygens or hydroxy groups of the parent carbohydrate are replaced by sulfur or -SR.
    
    The algorithm works in two parts:
      1) It inspects ring systems of size 5 or 6 that have the character expected
         for a sugar ring (most atoms are sp3 carbon with one heteroatom, normally O).
         If the one heteroatom is S instead of O, or if any ring carbon that would normally
         be substituted by –OH instead bears a sulfur substituent (and that S is not part of a glucosinolate leaving group motif),
         then the molecule is called a thiosugar.
      2) If no sugar ring is detected, a crude open‐chain search is performed: 
         if a contiguous chain of 4–6 carbons (found using simple DFS) shows evidence 
         of sulfo substitution replacing an “expected” –OH (i.e. a C with one neighbor S and at least one O neighbor),
         then the molecule is flagged.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a thiosugar, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
