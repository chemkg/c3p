Classifies: Saccharolipid â€“ Lipids that contain a carbohydrate moiety.
This function uses heuristic ring analysis to detect a sugar ring (carbohydrate moiety)
and a substructure search for a long aliphatic chain for the lipid portion.

def is_saccharolipid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a saccharolipid based on its SMILES string.
    A saccharolipid is defined as a lipid that contains a carbohydrate moiety.
    
    Heuristics used:
      - A carbohydrate moiety is approximated by detecting at least one
        ring of size 5 (furanose-like) or 6 (pyranose-like) that contains at least one oxygen atom.
      - A lipid is approximated by the presence of a long contiguous aliphatic chain,
        here defined as a chain of 8 or more carbon atoms.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a saccharolipid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
