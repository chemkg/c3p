Classifies: Aromatic primary alcohol
Definition:
  An aromatic primary alcohol is defined as any primary alcohol in which the alcoholic hydroxy group 
  is attached to a carbon which is itself bonded to an aromatic ring.
  
We improved the previous approach that solely relied on the SMARTS "c[CH2][OH]". Instead, we:
  1. Parse the molecule and add explicit hydrogens.
  2. Iterate over all carbon atoms.
  3. For each carbon, check if it is bonded to a terminal â€“OH group (i.e. its only oxygen neighbor has degree 1),
     and verify that it is a CH2 group (by counting its hydrogens).
  4. Also check whether that carbon is connected to at least one aromatic atom.
If all these criteria are met, we classify the molecule as an aromatic primary alcohol.

    Determines if a molecule is an aromatic primary alcohol based on its SMILES string.
    
    An aromatic primary alcohol is one in which the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a primary
    carbon (CH2) and that carbon is also bonded to at least one aromatic atom. This implementation 
    explicitly checks for these criteria.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an aromatic primary alcohol, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
