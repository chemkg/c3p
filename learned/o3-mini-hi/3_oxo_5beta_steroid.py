Classifies: 3-oxo-5β-steroid
Definition: Any 3-oxo steroid that has beta-configuration at position 5.

Revised Heuristics:
  1. Identify fused, non‐aromatic ring systems and try to extract a candidate steroid nucleus 
     comprised of exactly 4 rings whose sizes (when sorted) equal [5,6,6,6] and whose union 
     contains ≥17 carbon atoms.
  2. In that candidate nucleus, try to identify the 5‐membered ring and its shared (junction) 
     atom with any one 6‐membered ring. Then verify that this junction atom is chiral and its 
     local chirality annotation (as seen in the isomeric SMILES) uses “@@” (a proxy for 5β configuration).
  3. Require that one ketone (ring-bound) be located – but now also require that the ketone’s carbon
     is part of one of the candidate 6-membered rings.
     
If any of these criteria are not met then the molecule is not classified as a 3-oxo-5β-steroid.

    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-5β-steroid.
    
    Heuristic criteria:
      (1) The molecule must have a fused, non-aromatic ring system with a candidate nucleus made of
          exactly 4 rings whose sizes (when sorted) are [5,6,6,6] and whose union has ≥17 carbons.
      (2) Within that candidate nucleus, we identify the unique 5-membered ring. Then we require that
          at least one atom in the intersection of that 5-membered ring with a 6-membered ring (a candidate 
          for the C5 junction) is chiral and its annotation in the isomeric SMILES (via '@@') is consistent 
          with a beta configuration.
      (3) At least one ring-bound ketone must be present on one of the candidate 6-membered rings.
