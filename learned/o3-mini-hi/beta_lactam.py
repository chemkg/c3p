"""
Classifies: beta-lactam
A beta-lactam is defined as a cyclic amide in which the amide (nitrogenâ€“carbonyl) bond is
contained within a 4-membered ring.
This implementation:
  - Parses the SMILES, selects the largest fragment and adds explicit hydrogens.
  - Uses a SMARTS query to target the core beta-lactam motif:
        [NX3;R4][CX3;R4](=O)[CX3;R4][CX3;R4]
    This pattern requires a 4-membered ring (R4) that contains exactly one nitrogen (NX3)
    and three carbons (CX3), with one of the carbon atoms bearing an external carbonyl oxygen.
  - For each substructure match the code further verifies that:
      (a) the oxygen double-bond is outside the ring,
      (b) the bond between the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon is a single bond.
If such a substructure is found, the molecule is classified as a beta-lactam.

def is_beta_lactam(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a beta-lactam based on its SMILES string.

    The function uses a SMARTS query for the core beta-lactam ring, defined as a 
    4-membered ring consisting of one nitrogen and three carbons where one carbon (the carbonyl)
    is double bonded to an oxygen outside of the ring and is directly bonded to the ring nitrogen 
    through a single bond (the amide bond).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string representing the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a beta-lactam, False otherwise.
        str: A reason supporting the classification decision.
