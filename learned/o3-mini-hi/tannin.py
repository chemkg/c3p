"""
Classifies: TANNIN â€“ Any of a group of astringent polyphenolic vegetable principles
or compounds, chiefly complex glucosides of catechol and pyrogallol.

This function attempts to identify tannins by:
  1. Checking for polyphenolic substructures (catechol or pyrogallol motifs).
  2. Verifying that the molecule has at least two aromatic rings.
  3. Checking that the molecular weight is in a typical range for tannins (here > 300 Da).

Note: This is a heuristic approach. The chemistry of tannins is complex;
thus, the program may not be perfect for every structure.

def is_tannin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a tannin based on its SMILES string.
    
    The function looks for polyphenolic features:
      - Presence of catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) or pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene) motifs.
      - At least two aromatic rings.
      - A molecular weight above a minimal cutoff (here chosen as 300 Da) to avoid very small polyphenols.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a tannin, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
