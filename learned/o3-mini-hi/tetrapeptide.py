Classifies: Tetrapeptide
Definition: Any molecule that contains four amino‚Äêacid residues connected by peptide linkages.
For a linear tetrapeptide, there should be three backbone peptide bonds.
This function uses a heuristic: it looks for the substructure "C(=O)N" (which is actually 3 atoms)
and then filters the matches to ensure that the nitrogen is attached to a chiral (alpha) carbon.
