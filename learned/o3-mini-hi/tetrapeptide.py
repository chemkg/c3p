Classifies: Tetrapeptide
Definition: Any molecule that contains four amino‚Äêacid residues connected by peptide linkages.
A tetrapeptide (linear) should possess three backbone peptide bonds.
This function uses a heuristic: it looks for the substructure "C(=O)N" and then filters
the matches to ensure that the nitrogen is attached to a chiral carbon (i.e. the alpha carbon).

    Determines if a molecule is a tetrapeptide based on its SMILES string.
