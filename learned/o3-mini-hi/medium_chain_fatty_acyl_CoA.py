Classifies: A medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA
Definition: A fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group 
of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of any medium-chain fatty acid.

This program uses these heuristics:
  1. The molecule must contain a CoA moiety (detected via a characteristic SMARTS fragment).
  2. There must be a thioester group (C(=O)S) linking the fatty acyl chain to CoA.
  3. Starting from the thioester carbonyl carbon (ignoring the sulfur from CoA), 
     we "walk" along a linear, acyclic chain of carbon atoms 
     (ignoring atoms that belong to CoA) and count how many carbons are in the chain.
  4. The chain length (counting the carbonyl carbon as 1) must be between 6 and 12, inclusive.
  
If the chain contains a branch, we choose the longest linear extension.
Note that this is a heuristic and may still mis‚Äêclassify some edge cases.

def is_medium_chain_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether a molecule (given as a SMILES string) is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA.
    
    The definition requires that the molecule contains the CoA moiety and a thioester linkage(s)
    that attaches a fatty acyl chain. We then walk from the carbonyl carbon (of the thioester)
    along a contiguous chain (only carbons, not in rings and not in the CoA fragment) and require
    that the chain length (including the carbonyl carbon) is between 6 and 12.
    
    Args:
      smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
      
    Returns:
      bool: True if the molecule is classified as medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
