Classifies: Beta-lactam antibiotics
Definition: An organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic that contains a beta-lactam ring.
A beta-lactam ring is defined as a four-membered cyclic amide containing one nitrogen,
three carbons, and one of the carbons bears a carbonyl group (C=O).
In this implementation we search for a substructure matching the SMARTS pattern:
    N1C(=O)[C;R][C;R]1
which looks for a 4-membered ring (all three carbon atoms must be in a ring) with one nitrogen and a carbonyl.
Note: This is only a structural filter and may (or may not) include edge cases.

    Determines if a molecule is a beta-lactam antibiotic based on its SMILES string.
    We require that the molecule contains at least one beta-lactam ring:

      and with one of the carbon atoms bearing a double bond to oxygen.
