Classifies: Beta-lactam antibiotics
Definition: An organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic that contains a beta-lactam ring.
A beta-lactam ring is defined as a four-membered cyclic amide containing exactly one nitrogen,
three carbons, and with one of the carbons bearing a double bond to oxygen.
This implementation looks for a 4-membered ring (using RDKitâ€™s ring info) that satisfies these criteria.

    """
    Determines if a molecule appears to be a beta-lactam antibiotic based on its SMILES string.
    The molecule is considered to be a beta-lactam antibiotic if it contains a four-membered ring
    (cyclic amide) that:
      - consists of exactly one nitrogen and three carbons, and
      - has at least one carbon atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen (C=O)
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if a beta-lactam ring is found, False otherwise.
