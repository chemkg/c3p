Classifies: Oligosaccharide
An oligosaccharide is defined as a compound in which at least two monosaccharide units (ring systems commonly 
found in sugars) are joined by glycosidic (typically ether) linkages.
This heuristic implementation identifies candidate sugar rings (of size 5 or 6 with one ring oxygen) 
and then looks for oxygen atoms that bridge atoms from two different rings.

def is_oligosaccharide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an oligosaccharide based on its SMILES string. It uses simple heuristics:
      1. Identify candidate sugar rings: cyclic substructures of size 5 (furanose) or 6 (pyranose)
         that contain exactly one oxygen atom and no aromatic atoms.
      2. Search for glycosidic oxygen linkages â€“ non-ring oxygen atoms having two neighbors that belong 
         to different candidate sugar rings.
      3. If there are at least two sugar rings and at least one glycosidic linkage bridging them,
         then the molecule is classified as an oligosaccharide.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an oligosaccharide, else False.
        str: A reason explaining the outcome.
