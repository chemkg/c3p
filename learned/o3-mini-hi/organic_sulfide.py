    Determines if a molecule is an organic sulfide (thioether) based on its SMILES string.
    An organic sulfide is defined as a molecule containing at least one R-S-R moiety,
    where both R groups are not hydrogen (typically organic substituents, e.g., carbon-based).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is an organic sulfide, False otherwise.
