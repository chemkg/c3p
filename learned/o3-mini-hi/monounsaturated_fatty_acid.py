Classifies: Monounsaturated Fatty Acid

Definition: A fatty acid is defined to have a terminal carboxylic acid group and an acyclic carbon chain 
(with at least 5 carbons overall). A monounsaturated fatty acid must have exactly one carbonâ€“carbon unsaturation 
(the unsaturation may be a double bond; any triple bonds disqualify the molecule) along its longest continuous 
(aliphatic) carbon chain.

def is_monounsaturated_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a monounsaturated fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    
    This implementation:
      1. Parses the SMILES string.
      2. Rejects cyclic molecules.
      3. Identifies a terminal carboxylic acid group via a SMARTS pattern that catches both protonated 
         and deprotonated forms.
      4. Checks that the acid carbon (of the carboxyl group) is terminal (i.e. it has exactly one carbon neighbor).
      5. Builds a carbon-only graph (excluding the acid carbon) and 
         extracts the longest continuous carbon chain starting from the neighbor of the acid group.
      6. Counts the unsaturations (bonds whose bond type is DOUBLE) along that chain and immediately rejects any 
         triple bonds.
      7. Finally, classifies the molecule as a monounsaturated fatty acid only if exactly one double 
         bond is found in the chain.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        (bool, str): Tuple with True and a reason message if the classification is positive, 
                     else False and an explanation.
