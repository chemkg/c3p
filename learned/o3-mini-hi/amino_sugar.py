def is_amino_sugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an amino sugar based on its SMILES string.
    The algorithm does the following:
      1. Parse the SMILES string.
      2. Identify candidate sugar rings. Many sugars are cyclic ethers (furanoses (5-membered) 
         or pyranoses (6-membered)) that contain exactly one ring oxygen.
      3. For each such candidate ring, check the ring carbons for substituents.
         Under normal circumstances these carbons carry hydroxyl groups.
         If one or more of these substituents is a nitrogen (atomic number 7), then we consider
         that the corresponding -OH is replaced by an amino (or acetamido, etc.) group.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule appears to be an amino sugar, False otherwise.
        str: A brief explanation of the classification.
