Classifies: CHEBI:73080 hemiaminal
"""
"""
Classifies: Hemi-aminal compounds
Definition: Any organic amino compound that has an amino group and a hydroxy group 
attached to the same tetrahedral (sp3) carbon that carries exactly one hydrogen.
Hemiaminals are intermediates in imine formation.
Improvement: Instead of strictly requiring exactly three heavy atom bonds, we 
simply require that an sp3 (non-aromatic) carbon with exactly one hydrogen has at 
least one single-bonded OH group (oxygen with â‰¥1 hydrogen) and at least one single-
bonded amino group (nitrogen). This "looser" matching may catch hemiaminals embedded
in complex architectures while hopefully reducing false negatives.

    """
    Determines if a molecule contains a hemiaminal motif.
    A hemiaminal is defined here as a tetrahedral (sp3, non-aromatic) carbon 
    carrying exactly one hydrogen that is connected via single bonds to both a
    hydroxyl group (-OH) (where the oxygen itself has at least one hydrogen) and an 
    amino group (-NH, -NHR, or -NR2).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains a hemiaminal motif, False otherwise.
