Classifies: CHEBI:47016 tetrahydrofuranone

We need to analyze the previous code and the outcomes. The prior solution simply iterated over every five‐membered ring, checked for the correct atoms (only one oxygen and four carbons, no aromatics, and no atom in > 2 rings), and then looked for a ring‐carbon (with degree 3) that has an exocyclic double-bound oxygen whose degree is 1. That worked well for many examples but accepted many false positives. Why would that be? 

One strong possibility is that in cases of fused or bridged rings (or where the oxolane is embedded in a larger framework), a five‐membered ring might not really represent an isolated lactone environment even though it meets the simple atom count. We must also check that the candidate ring is “strictly isolated” in the sense that the carbonyl carbon’s non‐ring double bond is unique. For example, we could require that its double bond is with an oxygen that is not involved in any other multiple bonding or ring memberships, and that it is terminal. We also may check that the candidate carbonyl oxygen is not attached to any heavy (non-hydrogen) substituent besides the carbonyl carbon. 

Furthermore, we might improve the check by validating the connectivity of all ring atoms: in a true tetrahydrofuranone, the four carbon atoms should be sp3 and only connected to atoms from the ring except for that one carbonyl bond. Thus, we could also demand that the candidate carbonyl carbon has exactly two bonds in the ring and one out-of-ring bond (the carbonyl double bond) – and that the in-ring bonds indeed connect to atoms of the ring. 

Thus, the improvements we can add:
• When iterating over candidate rings, not only check count and nonaromaticity but also confirm that the two ring bonds on the candidate carbon are indeed to other atoms in that same ring.
• When evaluating the double bond, check that the exocyclic oxygen’s only bond is to this carbon, and that it is not ambiguous (for example, its degree is exactly 1). This helps eliminate cases where a multi-oxygen substituent might mimic the pattern.
• Possibly check that the overall ring is “isolated” in that none of its ring atoms belong to more than one (or at most two) rings. (We already did this, but we may refine it slightly.)

Implementing these improvements can help reduce false positives. 

Below is the improved version of is_tetrahydrofuranone. 

I'll now provide a single Python code block with these improvements.
