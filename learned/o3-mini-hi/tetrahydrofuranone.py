    """
    Determines if a molecule is a tetrahydrofuranone based on its SMILES string.
    
    A tetrahydrofuranone is defined as any molecule that contains a 5-membered ring (oxolane)
    with exactly one oxygen and four carbon atoms, where at least one of the carbon atoms in that ring 
    has a double-bonded oxygen (an oxo group) attached (which can be either part of a lactone ring or a substituent).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a tetrahydrofuranone, False otherwise.
