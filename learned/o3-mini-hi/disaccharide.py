"""
Classifies: Disaccharide
A disaccharide is defined as a compound in which two monosaccharides are joined by a glycosidic bond.
This algorithm makes two key checks:
  1) Identify candidate monosaccharide rings â€“ we assume these are 5-membered (furanose) or 6-membered (pyranose)
     rings that contain exactly one ring oxygen and the remaining ring atoms are carbons.
  2) Check that exactly two such rings are found and that there is at least one exocyclic oxygen 
     that bonds to one atom in one ring and one atom in the other (i.e. a glycosidic linkage).

def is_disaccharide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a disaccharide based on its SMILES string.

    A disaccharide should be composed of exactly two monosaccharide rings (typically 5- or 6-membered rings
    with one ring oxygen and the rest carbons) connected by a glycosidic linkage, which is assumed here to be
    an exocyclic oxygen that is simultaneously bonded to atoms in both rings.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a disaccharide, False otherwise
