"""
Classifies: CHEBI:26333 prostaglandin
"""
"""
Classifies: Prostanoid derivatives (prostaglandins)
Definition: Naturally occurring compounds derived from the parent C20 acid, prostanoic acid.
Heuristics used:
1. The molecule must contain a five‚Äêmembered ring composed solely of carbon atoms (the prostanoid core).
2. The molecule must contain at least one carboxyl/ester group (the C(=O)O motif) as a sign of the acid functionality.
3. The total number of carbon atoms should be in a range roughly compatible with a C20 backbone (allowing modifications).
If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False with a reason.

from rdkit import Chem

def is_prostaglandin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether the given SMILES string represents a prostaglandin derivative.
    
    The function uses heuristics:
      - Checks that the molecule contains a five-membered (cyclopentane) carbon ring.
      - Checks that the molecule contains at least one carboxyl/ester functional group
        (a C(=O)O motif).
      - Checks that the number of carbon atoms is in an expected range (roughly C17 to C27).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is likely a prostaglandin derivative, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the classification decision.
