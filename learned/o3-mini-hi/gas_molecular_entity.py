"""
Classifies: Gas Molecular Entity
Definition: Any main group molecular entity that is gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (STP; 0Â°C and 100 kPa)
Note: This classifier uses heuristics based on element composition, molecular weight, and the overall size of the molecule.
It may not be 100% accurate.

def is_gas_molecular_entity(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a given molecule (specified as a SMILES string) likely corresponds to a gas molecular entity at STP,
    based on its composition and size.

    Heuristic criteria used:
      1. The molecule must be parseable.
      2. It must consist only of main group elements (allowed atomic numbers: H, He, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg,
         Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Br, Kr, I, Xe, Rn).
      3. Its molecular weight must be below a threshold (here, 300 Da) since most gaseous molecules are small.
      4. The molecule should not be too large (here, we require no more than 25 heavy atoms).
      5. The molecule must be contiguous (a single molecular entity).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a gas molecular entity, False otherwise.
        str: A reason for the classification.
