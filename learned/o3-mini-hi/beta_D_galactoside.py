Classifies: beta-D-galactoside

Definition: Any D-galactoside having beta-configuration at its anomeric centre.
A beta-D-galactoside here is defined as a molecule that contains a complete beta-D-galactopyranoside fragment.
A complete beta-D-galactopyranoside fragment is defined as a pyranose ring (six‚Äêmembered ring with one oxygen
and five carbons) in which an external substituent (the aglycone) is attached via an oxygen to the anomeric carbon;
the anomeric carbon is drawn with beta configuration ([C@@H]), and the ring atoms have the expected relative arrangement.
In beta-D-galactopyranose the exocyclic CH2OH is attached at C5.
Because many alternative representations exist, this approach is strict and may fail if stereo is not defined.

def is_beta_D_galactoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a beta-D-galactoside based on its SMILES string.
    
    The function first parses the SMILES and assigns stereochemistry. It uses a refined SMARTS pattern
    that looks for an external substituent attached via an oxygen to an anomeric carbon in beta configuration.
    The pattern enforces a complete six-membered pyranose ring (with one ring oxygen and five carbons)
    with the exocyclic CH2OH group bonded at the appropriate ring carbon.
    
    The SMARTS pattern we use here is:
      [*]O[C@@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](CO)O1
    This denotes:
      [*]O       : any aglycone attached via an oxygen
      [C@@H]1   : the anomeric carbon in beta configuration (start ring number 1)
         O      : the ring oxygen
         [C@H](O): C2 with an OH
         [C@@H](O): C3 with an OH
         [C@H](O): C4 with an OH
         [C@H](CO): C5 with an exocyclic CH2OH (note the CH2OH group, not in the ring)
      O1         : closes the ring (the ring oxygen already included)
    
    In addition to matching the SMARTS, we verify that the atoms in the sugar ring (the atoms with indices
    corresponding to the anomeric carbon and the next four atoms plus the oxygen closing the ring)
    actually form a ring of size 6.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains a complete beta-D-galactoside fragment, False otherwise.
