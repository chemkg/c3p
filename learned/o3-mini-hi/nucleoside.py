Classifies: Nucleoside
Definition: An N-glycosyl compound that has both a nucleobase 
           (normally adenine, guanine, xanthine, thymine, cytosine or uracil)
           and either a ribose or deoxyribose as functional parents.
Improvements:
    - Reject molecules with phosphorus (e.g. nucleotides) or with very high molecular weight (>500 Da).
    - Identify a candidate sugar ring: a five-membered ring (furanose) containing exactly 1 oxygen and 4 carbons.
    - Instead of strictly enforcing that a substituent has exactly two hydrogens, we now require that some sugar carbon
      bears an exocyclic neighbor which is a carbon that in turn is attached to at least one oxygen bearing a hydrogen.
    - Identify an N-glycosidic bond between a sugar carbon (typically the anomeric carbon) and a nucleobase nitrogen.

def is_nucleoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nucleoside based on its SMILES string.
    
    A nucleoside is defined as an N-glycosyl compound that contains:
      - A five-membered sugar ring (ribose or deoxyribose) with exactly one oxygen and four carbons.
      - An exocyclic substituent on the sugar ring corresponding to the 5â€²-group,
        which is normally a CH2OH (or related) fragment.
      - A nucleobase (typically a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle containing at least one nitrogen)
        that is bonded via an N-glycosidic bond to a sugar carbon.
    
    Additional filters:
      - Molecules containing phosphorus atoms (likely nucleotides) are rejected.
      - Molecules with high molecular weight (>500 Da) are rejected.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        (bool, str): True along with a message if the molecule qualifies as a nucleoside,
                     False along with the reason if it does not.
