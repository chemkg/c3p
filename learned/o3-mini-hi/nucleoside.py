"""
Classifies: Nucleoside
Definition: An N-glycosyl compound that has both a nucleobase 
           (normally adenine, guanine, xanthine, thymine, cytosine or uracil)
           and either a ribose or deoxyribose as functional parents.
Improvements:
    - Reject molecules with phosphorus (e.g. nucleotides) or with very high molecular weight (>500 Da).
    - Identify a candidate sugar ring: a five-membered ring (furanose) containing exactly 1 oxygen and 4 carbons.
    - Look for an exocyclic substituent (expected at the 5'-position) that is a CH2OH (or CH2Oâ€¦) group.
      Rather than enforcing exactly 2 hydrogens, we now allow a small flexibility (>=1 hydrogen)
      and require that the candidate carbon is sp3 and it is directly bonded to an oxygen that itself bears at least one hydrogen.
    - Identify an N-glycosidic bond between a (typically anomeric) sugar carbon and a nucleobase nitrogen.

def is_nucleoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nucleoside based on its SMILES string.
    
    A nucleoside should include:
      (1) A sugar ring: typically a five-membered (furanose) ring composed of 4 carbons and 1 oxygen.
          In addition, the sugar should carry an exocyclic substituent corresponding to the 5'-group, 
          usually a CH2OH group (or CH2O in certain depictions).
      (2) A nucleobase: a heterocyclic ring (of size 5 or 6) containing at least one nitrogen.
      (3) An N-glycosidic bond: a covalent bond linking a sugar carbon (commonly the anomeric carbon)
          to a nitrogen atom that belongs to the nucleobase.
    
    Additional filters:
      - Molecules containing phosphorus atoms are rejected (these are likely nucleotides or derivatives).
      - Molecules with high molecular weight (>500 Da) are rejected.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule fits as a nucleoside, False otherwise.
        str: Human-readable reason for classification.
