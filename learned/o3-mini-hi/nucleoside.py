Classifies: Nucleoside
Definition: An N-glycosyl compound that has both a nucleobase 
           (normally adenine, guanine, xanthine, thymine, cytosine or uracil)
           and either a ribose or deoxyribose as functional parents.
Improvement notes:
  - Reject molecules with phosphorus (e.g. nucleotides) or very high molecular weight.
  - Locate a candidate sugar ring as a five-membered ring that contains exactly 1 oxygen and 4 carbons.
  - Also require that the sugar ring carries an exocyclic substituent matching a CH2OH (ribose) or CH2O pattern.
  - Identify a bond from a sugar carbon (ideally the anomeric carbon) to a nitrogen atom that is not in the sugar but belongs
    to a separate ring (of size 5 or 6) as a minimal nucleobase.

def is_nucleoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nucleoside based on its SMILES string.
    
    A nucleoside should include:
      (1) A sugar ring: typically a five-membered (furanose) ring composed of 4 carbons and 1 oxygen.
          In addition, the sugar should carry an exocyclic CH2OH group (the 5' unit).
      (2) A nucleobase: a heterocyclic ring containing at least one nitrogen (typically 5- or 6-membered).
      (3) An N-glycosidic bond: a covalent bond connecting a sugar carbon (usually the anomeric carbon)
          to a nitrogen atom that is part of the nucleobase ring.
    
    Additional filters:
      - Molecules containing phosphorus atoms are rejected (nucleotides or phospho-derivatives are not nucleosides).
      - Molecules with very high molecular weight (>500 Da) are rejected.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule fits as a nucleoside, False otherwise.
        str: Human-readable reason for classification.
