Classifies: flavanones â€“ Members of the class of flavans with a 
3,4-dihydro-2-aryl-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one skeleton and its substituted derivatives.
This pattern is detected by searching for a bicyclic benzopyran-4-one core 
with an extra aryl substituent at the C-2 position.
The SMARTS pattern used is: "c1ccc2C(=O)CC([$([c])])Oc2c1"
which represents the 2-phenylchroman-4-one scaffold.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavanone based on its SMILES string.
    
    Flavanones are defined by the presence of the 3,4-dihydro-2-aryl-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one scaffold.
    In this approach we search for a benzopyran-4-one fused system where:
      - A dihydropyran ring (containing one oxygen and a ketone at the 4 position)
      - Is fused to an aromatic ring (the A ring)
      - And has an extra aryl substituent attached at the C-2 position (verified by forcing the substituent 
        to start with an aromatic atom via the SMARTS constraint [$([c])]).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a flavanone, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
