    """
    Determines if a molecule is a quinic acid derivative based on its SMILES string.
    For our purposes, quinic acid is defined as a cyclitol (here, a non‚Äêaromatic cyclohexane)
    that carries a carboxylic acid group. In many natural derivatives the cyclohexane ring may 
    be decorated (e.g., by caffeoyl, feruloyl or coumaroyl esters) but the core remains a cyclohexanecarboxylate.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as quinic acid derivative, False otherwise
