"""
Classifies: CHEBI:17636 sphingomyelin d18:1
"""
"""
Classifies: Sphingomyelin d18:1 â€“ any sphingomyelin having sphingosine as the sphingoid component.
Heuristic criteria used here:
  1. The molecule must contain the phosphocholine headgroup (SMARTS: "COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C").
  2. It must contain an amide bond (SMARTS: "NC(=O)") which connects a fatty acyl chain to the sphingoid base.
  3. The overall number of carbons is expected to be high (here we require at least 35 carbons).
  4. There is at least one isolated C=C double bond present.
Note: These criteria are heuristic and may not cover all cases.
