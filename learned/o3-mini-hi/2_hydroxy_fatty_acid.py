Classifies: 2-hydroxy fatty acid
Definition: Any fatty acid with a hydroxy functional group in the alpha- or 2-position.
A fatty acid is essentially a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and an aliphatic chain.
This function checks for a carboxylic acid group and then verifies that the alpha carbon
(has a bond to the carboxyl carbon) is hydroxylated.

def is_2_hydroxy_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 2-hydroxy fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    It looks for a carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) group and then inspects the carbon directly
    attached to the acid group (the alpha carbon) for a hydroxyl (â€“OH) group.
