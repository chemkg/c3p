Classifies: Oxo fatty acid
Definition: Any fatty acid containing at least one aldehydic or ketonic group
            in addition to the carboxylic acid group.
Additional criteria (heuristic):
  - The molecule must contain only typical fatty acid elements (C, O, and H).
  - It must be acyclic (no rings).
  - There must be exactly one carboxylic acid group (terminal â€“C(=O)[O]H).
  - The molecule must contain at least a minimal number of carbons (>=5) for meaningful fatty acid structure.
  - In addition, an extra oxo function (ketone or aldehyde) must be present
    (its carbonyl is not part of the acid).

def is_oxo_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an oxo fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    
    The molecule must contain:
      - A single carboxylic acid group (as in fatty acids) that should appear at a terminus.
      - At least one additional oxo function (ketone or aldehyde) on a different carbon.
    In addition, the molecule must be acyclic and contain only C, O and H atoms.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is an oxo fatty acid, False otherwise.
        str: A reason for the classification.
