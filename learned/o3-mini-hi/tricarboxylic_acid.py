"""
Classifies: Tricarboxylic Acid (An oxoacid containing three carboxy groups.)
 
This improved version uses two SMARTS patterns to detect carboxyl groups 
in either protonated ([CX3](=O)[OX2H]) or ionized ([CX3](=O)[O-]) form and 
then checks that exactly three unique carboxyl carbons are detected.
It also excludes molecules that contain metals or other non‚Äêorganic atoms,
since many false positives were found from salts or complexes.
Note that this classification is heuristic.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a tricarboxylic acid based on its SMILES string.
    A tricarboxylic acid is defined as an oxoacid containing three carboxy groups.
    This function checks if the input molecule has exactly three carboxyl groups
    (in protonated or deprotonated form) and that it is composed solely of
    typical non-metal organic atoms (C, H, N, O, S).
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a tricarboxylic acid, False otherwise.
