Classifies: CHEBI:18254 ribonucleoside
"""
"""
Classifies: any nucleoside where the sugar component is D-ribose (ribonucleoside)
Definition: A ribonucleoside is a nucleoside having its nucleobase linked
             via an N-glycosidic bond to a D-ribofuranose (a five-membered ring
             containing 1 oxygen and 4 carbons, plus an exocyclic CH2OH group at the 5'-position).
Improvements:
  1. Reject compounds containing phosphorus.
  2. Look for five-membered rings that have exactly 1 oxygen and 4 carbons.
  3. For each such ring, check that at least one ring carbon has an exocyclic CH2OH substituent.
  4. Also require that at least one ring carbon is directly bonded (outside the ring) to
     an aromatic nitrogen â€“ taken as a proxy for a nucleobase linkage.
If all these conditions are met, then the molecule is classified as a ribonucleoside.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a ribonucleoside (nucleoside with D-ribose sugar)
    by checking for (i) the absence of phosphorus, (ii) the presence of a five-membered ring
    with exactly one oxygen and four carbons, (iii) existence of an exocyclic CH2OH group (the 5'-substituent),
    and (iv) attachment of the sugar ring to an aromatic nitrogen (i.e. nucleobase linkage).
