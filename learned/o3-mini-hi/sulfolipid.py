    Determines if a molecule is a sulfolipid based on its SMILES string.
    A sulfolipid is defined as a compound containing a sulfonic acid residue (S(=O)(=O)[O] form)
    that is directly attached (via a Câ€“S bond) to a lipid-like long aliphatic chain.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
