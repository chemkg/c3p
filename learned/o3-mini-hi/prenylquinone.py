Classifies: prenylquinone
A prenylquinone is defined as a quinone substituted by a polyprenyl‚Äêderived side chain.
This version improves upon the previous heuristics by:
  - Using more relaxed SMARTS for quinone cores (allowing some substitutions)
  - Requiring that the prenyl fragment be directly attached to the quinone core.

def is_prenylquinone(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a prenylquinone based on its SMILES string.
    This routine requires that the molecule contains:
      1. A quinone core (detected by one of two SMARTS patterns that allow for substituents)
      2. A prenyl-derived side chain that is directly attached to the quinone core. 
         We look for a typical isoprene fragment "[CH2]C=C([CH3])", and verify that at least one
         matching fragment is bonded to an atom in the quinone core.
         
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a prenylquinone, False otherwise.
