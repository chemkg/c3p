Classifies: prenylquinone
A prenylquinone is defined as a quinone substituted by a polyprenyl‚Äêderived side chain.
This version improves upon the previous heuristics by broadening the quinone core SMARTS 
to capture common substituted benzoquinones and naphthoquinones.

    Determines if a molecule is a prenylquinone based on its SMILES string.
    This routine requires that the molecule contains:
      1. A quinone core (detected by one or more SMARTS patterns that allow for substitution)
      2. A prenyl-derived side chain directly attached to an atom in the quinone core.
