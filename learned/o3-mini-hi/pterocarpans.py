"""
Classifies: Pterocarpans â€“ Members of the class of benzofurochromene with a 6a,11a-dihydro-6H-[1]benzofuro[3,2-c]chromene skeleton (and substituted derivatives).
They are 3,4-dihydro derivatives of coumestans and generally resemble isoflavanoids.

def is_pterocarpans(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a pterocarpan based on its SMILES string.
    
    The classification is based on the presence of the benzofurochromene core.
    A simplified core is represented by a dihydrofuran ring fused to two benzene rings.
    The SMARTS pattern used here is "C1COc2ccccc2Oc3ccccc13", which captures this tricyclic system.
    Note: This pattern is a simplified representation and will capture many substituted derivatives.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains the pterocarpan core, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the classification result.
