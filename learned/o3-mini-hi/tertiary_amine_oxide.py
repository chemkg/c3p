Classifies: Tertiary amine oxide
Definition: An N-oxide in which a tetrahedral (spÂ³) nitrogen (with a +1 formal charge) 
is bonded to exactly one oxygen atom (with a -1 formal charge via a single bond) and three carbon atoms.
Furthermore, for each carbon substituent the atoms immediately bonded (except the candidate N) must be only carbons or hydrogens,
unless the bond to that neighbor is part of a ring that is composed exclusively of carbons and hydrogens.

def is_tertiary_amine_oxide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule contains a tertiary amine oxide functional group based on its SMILES string.
    
    Improved algorithm:
      1. Parse the SMILES string.
      2. Look for candidate nitrogen atoms with:
         - Symbol "N" and formal charge of +1.
         - Tetrahedral geometry (degree = 4) and not aromatic.
      3. For each candidate N, require exactly one neighbor oxygen atom (with -1 formal charge) 
         that is single-bonded and has no other attachment (degree == 1) and exactly three carbon neighbors.
      4. For each carbon neighbor, check every immediate neighbor (except the candidate N). 
         For each such bond:
           - If the neighbor atom is carbon or hydrogen, it is allowed.
           - Otherwise, if the bond between the carbon and that atom is part of a ring AND at least one ring 
             that contains both atoms is composed only of carbons and hydrogens, then the connection is allowed.
           - Otherwise, the substituent is too complex.
      5. If a candidate nitrogen satisfies all the tests, return True and a clear explanation.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if a tertiary amine oxide functional group is found, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
