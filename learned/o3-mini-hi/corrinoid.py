Classifies: a corrinoid
Definition:
  A corrinoid is a derivative of the corrin nucleus, which contains four reduced or 
  partly reduced pyrrole rings joined in a macrocycle by three =C- groups and one 
  direct carbon-carbon bond linking alpha positions.
  
Improvements compared to a previous attempt:
  - For SSSR rings, instead of accepting only rings of size 15 or 19, we relax
    the union-of-pyrrole fragments approach to allow a connected macrofragment of
    size 13 to 21 atoms (to catch slight variations).
  - We add a check that within the putative macrocycle there are at least three conjugated (double or aromatic) bonds.
  - Cobalt is used only as extra evidence when there are at least three pyrrole-like fragments.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a corrinoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    Heuristics:
      1. Use default SSSR to look for a macrocycle of size 15 or 19 with exactly 4 nitrogen atoms.
         (If that is found, then we assume a corrinoid core is present.)
      2. Otherwise, search for pyrrole-like rings with the above SMARTS.
         Merge the atoms from all such rings and, if the resulting union is connected,
         has a size between 13 and 21 atoms, and exactly 4 nitrogen atoms, then also check
         that at least three bonds inside this union are either double bonds or aromatic.
      3. As a bonus hint, if cobalt (atomic number 27) is present along with at least 3 pyrrole-like rings,
         that supports (but does not by itself determine) a corrinoid assignment.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

        (bool, str): Tuple with classification (True=corrinoid, False=not) and an explanation.
