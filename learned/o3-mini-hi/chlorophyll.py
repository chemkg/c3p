def is_chlorophyll(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a chlorophyll based on its SMILES string.
    
    Chlorophyll is defined (approximately) as a magnesium porphyrin that meets the 
    following criteria:
      1. The molecule is neutral.
      2. Contains at least one magnesium atom.
      3. At least one magnesium atom is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms 
         (as in the porphyrin core).
      4. Contains at least five rings in total, and at least one of these rings is five-membered.
      5. Contains a long aliphatic (phytol) chain, here defined as a contiguous chain 
         of at least 10 carbon atoms outside any ring.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as chlorophyll, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
