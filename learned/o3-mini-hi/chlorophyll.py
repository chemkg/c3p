"""
Classifies: Chlorophyll â€“ a family of magnesium porphyrins defined by the presence
of a fifth (non-pyrrole) ring beyond the four pyrrole-like rings. Although these molecules
usually include a long aliphatic (phytol) chain, its absence (as in chlorophyllides) is allowed.

def is_chlorophyll(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is classified as chlorophyll based on its SMILES string.
    
    Chlorophyll (and chlorophyllides) are defined (approximately) as follows:
      1. The molecule is neutral.
      2. Contains at least one magnesium atom.
      3. At least one magnesium atom is coordinated to at least four nitrogen atoms (the porphyrin core).
      4. Has a fused ring system containing at least five rings overall, with at least one being five-membered 
         (the extra isocyclic ring beyond the four pyrrole-like rings).
      5. Ideally contains a long aliphatic chain (phytol chain), defined as a contiguous chain of at least 10 carbon atoms
         outside any ring. However, the absence of such a chain (as in chlorophyllides) will not cause rejection.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as chlorophyll (or chlorophyllide), False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the classification decision.
