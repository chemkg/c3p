Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The main issue was that the core SMARTS pattern wasn't matching any of the test cases. Looking at the error messages, all the examples failed because the core structure wasn't found. 

First, I need to analyze the core SMARTS pattern used. The previous code used "[C@H](COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C)(COC)OC(=O)". Maybe the way the phosphocholine group is represented is incorrect. In some of the example SMILES, the phosphate group is written with different atom ordering or charges. For example, the phosphate might be written as P([O-])(=O)(OCC...) instead of P(=O)([O-])... The order of the oxygen atoms in the SMARTS might matter here.

Also, the stereochemistry in the SMARTS might be too strict. The examples have the sn-glycerol configuration, but maybe the SMARTS isn't capturing the correct stereochemistry. The previous pattern uses [C@H], but perhaps the exact configuration needs to be specified differently. Wait, in the example SMILES, the chiral center is marked with [@H], like in OC[C@H](...). So the SMARTS should correctly represent the stereochemistry at that carbon.

Another issue could be the way the ether and ester groups are connected. The previous code checked for COC (ether) and OC(=O) (ester), but maybe the SMARTS isn't flexible enough to account for different chain lengths or branching. Also, in some SMILES, the phosphocholine group might be attached in a different order, which the SMARTS pattern might not account for.

Let me look at one of the example SMILES: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCOC[C@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)CCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCC. The core structure here is [C@H](COC...)(COP...)(OC(=O)...). The SMARTS should match this arrangement. The previous SMARTS might have the groups in the wrong order. The pattern should have the three substituents: one is COP(=O)..., another is COC (the ether), and the third is OC(=O) (the ester). The order in the SMARTS might need to be adjusted to match the actual connectivity.

Wait, in the SMARTS pattern, the groups are ordered as (COP...)(COC)(OC(=O)). But in the actual molecule, the groups are attached as COC (sn-1), OC(=O) (sn-2), and COP... (sn-3). The SMARTS pattern might not be capturing this correctly. Maybe the order of the substituents in the SMARTS is causing a mismatch. The chiral center's substituents need to be in the correct order.

So, the core SMARTS should represent the correct substituents at each position. The correct structure is sn-1: alkyl-O-CH2-, sn-2: acyl-O-C(=O)-, sn-3: phosphocholine. The chiral center (C@H) should have the three oxygen-containing groups in the correct positions.

Another problem could be the way the phosphocholine group is written. The previous SMARTS has "COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C", but in some examples, the phosphate might be written as P(O-)(=O)(OCC...). The SMARTS should account for possible variations in the order of the oxygen atoms attached to phosphorus. Also, the charge on the phosphate and the choline might need to be considered.

Moreover, the previous code checked for the ether oxygen and ester oxygen using additional SMARTS patterns, but if the core SMARTS isn't matching, those checks never happen. So the primary issue is the core SMARTS pattern not matching the examples.

To fix this, I need to adjust the core SMARTS to correctly represent the structure. Let's try a more flexible approach. The core should have:

- A chiral carbon (C@) attached to three groups:
  1. A CH2-O-alkyl (ether at sn-1)
  2. A CO-O-acyl (ester at sn-2)
  3. A CH2-O-phosphate-choline (sn-3)

The SMARTS pattern should capture this. Let's construct the SMARTS step by step.

The chiral center: [C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP...

Wait, maybe the correct SMARTS is:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP(=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But the order of the groups around the chiral center matters in SMARTS. The actual arrangement in the molecule is:

- The chiral carbon is connected to:
  - One oxygen (from the ether COC)
  - Another oxygen (from the ester OC(=O))
  - The phosphate group (COP...)
  - The hydrogen (as [C@H])

So the SMARTS should be written as [C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP... but I need to ensure the connectivity is correct.

Alternatively, using a more generic SMARTS that matches the groups regardless of order but ensures their presence. However, stereochemistry is important here, so the SMARTS must correctly represent the sn configuration.

Looking at the example SMILES, the structure is:

OCC@H( (sn-1: O-alkyl), (sn-2: O-acyl), (sn-3: O-phosphate) )

So the SMARTS should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP...

But perhaps the previous SMARTS had the groups in the wrong order, causing the match to fail.

Let me try creating a new core SMARTS pattern:

core_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("""
    [C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP(=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C
""")

But wait, the actual connectivity in the molecule is that the chiral center is connected to three oxygen-containing groups and a hydrogen. Let's look at an example SMILES:

For 1-O-octadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the SMILES is:

CCCC...COC[C@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)...

Breaking this down, the chiral center is attached to:

- COC (the ether from sn-1)
- OC(=O) (the ester from sn-2)
- OP... (the phosphate from sn-3)
- The hydrogen (as part of the [C@H])

So the correct SMARTS should have the three groups: COC, OC(=O), and COP...

The previous SMARTS was written as [C@H](COP(=O)...)(COC)OC(=O), which might have the groups in the wrong order. The order in SMARTS is based on the order of the atoms in the SMILES. So if the SMILES is written as [C@H](COC)(COP...)OC(=O), the SMARTS should reflect that.

Alternatively, using a more flexible SMARTS that doesn't depend on the order of the substituents. For example, using a SMARTS that checks for the presence of all three groups connected to the chiral center, regardless of their order. But since stereochemistry is crucial, the order must match the actual arrangement.

Another approach is to use a SMARTS that matches the core structure without specifying the exact order of the substituents, but that's tricky because SMARTS is sensitive to atom order.

Alternatively, maybe the previous SMARTS didn't account for possible branching or different atom orders in the phosphate group. For example, the phosphate could be written as P([O-])(=O)(OCC...) instead of P(=O)([O-])OCC...

In the example SMILES, the phosphate is written as COP([O-])(=O)OCC..., which is P with an O- charge, double bond O, and OCC... So the SMARTS should match that. The previous SMARTS used "P(=O)([O-])OCC", which might not match if the order is different. SMARTS is sensitive to the order of adjacent atoms. So the correct SMARTS for the phosphate group should be "P([O-])(=O)(OCC...)" instead of "P(=O)([O-])...".

In SMILES, the order of the atoms around P matters. So if the SMILES writes P([O-])(=O)(OCC...), the SMARTS should have the same order. The previous SMARTS used "P(=O)([O-])OCC", which would not match the SMILES where the O- is written first.

So, the correct SMARTS for the phosphate group should be "P([O-])(=O)(OCC[N+](C)(C)C)". Let's adjust that in the core pattern.

Putting it all together, the core SMARTS should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But wait, in the example SMILES, the phosphate is attached as COP([O-])(=O)OCC..., so the SMARTS should have COP([O-])(=O)... to match.

Therefore, the corrected core SMARTS pattern should be:

core_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("""
    [C@H](COC)(OC(=O))COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C
""")

But I need to verify the connectivity. Let's break down the example SMILES:

The chiral center is connected to:

- COC (sn-1 alkyl ether)
- OC(=O) (sn-2 acyl ester)
- OP(...) (sn-3 phosphocholine)
- H (as part of the chiral center)

So the SMARTS should have those three groups attached to the chiral carbon. The previous SMARTS had the groups in a different order, which might have caused the mismatch.

Another possible issue is that the SMARTS might not account for the fact that the ester oxygen (OC(=O)) is connected to a carbonyl group. The previous code checked for the ester oxygen and carbonyl, but if the core SMARTS isn't matching, those checks are never reached.

Additionally, the previous code checked for the presence of the ether oxygen and whether it's connected to an alkyl chain. However, if the core SMARTS didn't match, these checks weren't performed.

To fix the core SMARTS, I need to ensure it correctly matches the structure in the examples. Let's try creating a SMARTS that captures the chiral center with the three substituents: COC (ether), OC(=O) (ester), and COP (phosphate).

The correct SMARTS might be:

[C@H](CO*)(OC(=O)*)COP(=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But using wildcards for the rest of the chains. However, SMARTS requires explicit connections. Alternatively, using more generic patterns.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the previous SMARTS didn't account for the fact that the COC (ether) is connected to a longer alkyl chain. The SMARTS had "COC" which matches any ether, but in the examples, the COC is part of a longer chain. However, SMARTS should still match that as a substructure.

Alternatively, the problem might be with the stereochemistry. The previous SMARTS used [C@H], but the actual configuration in the examples might be [C@@H]. Wait, looking at the example SMILES:

For instance, the first example has "[C@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)...". The chiral center is written as [C@H], so the SMARTS should match that configuration. But perhaps the previous SMARTS had the substituents in a different order, leading to a different stereochemistry.

The order of substituents in SMARTS is important for stereochemistry. The SMARTS [C@H](A)(B)C refers to a specific arrangement. If the actual molecule has the substituents in a different order, the stereochemistry might not match.

In the example SMILES, the chiral center is attached to:

- The main chain (the glycerol backbone)
- The ether group (COC...)
- The ester group (OC(=O)...)
- The phosphate group (COP...)

The SMARTS needs to reflect the correct order of these groups around the chiral center to match the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, maybe the SMARTS was too restrictive by specifying the exact substituents, and a more flexible approach is needed. For example, using a SMARTS that checks for the presence of the three required groups (ether, ester, phosphate) without specifying their exact order, but that's not possible because stereochemistry is crucial.

Another possibility is that the SMARTS didn't account for the possibility of the phosphate group being in a different position. For example, in some SMILES, the phosphate might be written with the oxygen connected differently.

Wait, looking at one of the example SMILES: 

SMILES: P(OC[C@@H](COCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)OC(CCC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCCCC)=O)(=O)(OCC[N+](C)(C)C)[O-]

Here, the phosphate is connected as P(OC[...])(=O)(OCC...)[O-]. The SMARTS in the previous code might not match this arrangement because the phosphate is written differently. The previous SMARTS expected the phosphate to be COP(=O)... but in this case, it's P(...) with the O connected to the chiral center.

This indicates that the core structure can vary in how the phosphate is attached. The previous SMARTS assumed that the phosphate is directly attached to the chiral center via a COP group, but in this example, the phosphate is part of a larger group where the O is connected to the chiral center.

Wait, in this SMILES, the structure is:

The chiral center is part of O-C-C@H(...), where the phosphate is attached via an oxygen. So the SMARTS needs to account for this connectivity.

This suggests that the previous core SMARTS was incorrect because it assumed the phosphate is directly attached to the chiral center (COP...), but in some cases, the phosphate is part of a different branch.

This is a critical issue. For example, in the SMILES P(OC[...])(...), the phosphate is connected to the oxygen that's attached to the chiral center. So the structure is O-P, not C-O-P. Therefore, the previous SMARTS pattern, which looks for a C-O-P connection, would not match this case.

So the core structure in some examples has the phosphate group attached via an oxygen that's part of the glycerol backbone, not directly connected to the carbon. This means the previous SMARTS pattern is too restrictive.

To handle both cases (C-O-P and O-P), the core SMARTS needs to be adjusted. The correct structure should have the phosphate group connected via an oxygen to the chiral center's adjacent carbon. For example, the glycerol backbone is C-O-P, but in some SMILES, it's written as O-P.

Wait, the general structure of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is:

The glycerol is CH2-O-P... (sn-3), CH2-O-alkyl (sn-1), and CH-O-acyl (sn-2). So the phosphate is attached to the third carbon of glycerol via an oxygen.

In the example SMILES where the phosphate is written as P(OC[...])..., the oxygen connected to the chiral center is part of the phosphate group. So the structure is:

Chiral center -> O -> P(...)

Therefore, the correct SMARTS should account for this connectivity. The previous SMARTS looked for a carbon connected directly to the phosphate (COP...), but in this case, it's a carbon connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the phosphate (CO...P...).

This means the core SMARTS needs to match both possibilities, or the examples have different connectivity which the previous code didn't account for.

This is a major issue. The core SMARTS in the previous code was looking for a carbon connected to O-P (COP...), but in some examples, the connection is C-O-P-O-... (like in the SMILES starting with P(...)).

To fix this, the core SMARTS should match the glycerol backbone where the sn-3 position is connected to an oxygen that is part of the phosphate group. So the correct SMARTS should have:

- Chiral center (C@H)
- Connected to: 
   - COC (sn-1 ether)
   - OC(=O) (sn-2 ester)
   - O-P (sn-3 phosphate)

So the SMARTS should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P](=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But wait, in this case, the phosphate is connected via an oxygen to the chiral center. Let's construct this SMARTS.

The chiral center has three oxygen-containing groups:

1. COC (sn-1 ether)
2. OC(=O) (sn-2 ester)
3. O-P... (sn-3 phosphate)

So the SMARTS pattern should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P](=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

This would match the case where the phosphate is connected via an oxygen to the chiral center. However, in other examples, the phosphate is directly attached to the carbon (COP...). So the SMARTS needs to account for both possibilities.

Wait, no. The correct structure of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine has the phosphate group attached to the third carbon of glycerol via an oxygen. So the third carbon (sn-3) is CH2-O-P... So the SMARTS should have that oxygen between the carbon and the phosphate.

Looking at the example SMILES that starts with P(...):

SMILES: P(OC[C@@H](COCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)OC(=O)...)... 

Here, the phosphate is connected to the oxygen that's attached to the chiral center. So the structure is:

Chiral center -> O -> P(...)

Therefore, the correct SMARTS should include this O-P linkage. The previous SMARTS was looking for a direct C-O-P connection (COP), which is not the case here.

This means the core SMARTS needs to be adjusted to match either:

- C-O-P (as in COP...)
- Or C-O-P (as in O-P...)

Wait, no. The correct connectivity is always C-O-P for the sn-3 position. So the SMARTS should have the O-P group attached to the carbon.

But in the example SMILES, the phosphate is written as P(OC[...])..., which means the oxygen connected to the chiral center is part of the phosphate group. So the structure is:

Chiral center -> O -> P(...)

So the SMARTS should match [C@H](...)(...)(O[P...]).

Therefore, the correct core SMARTS should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P](=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But wait, in other examples, the phosphate is attached as COP(...), like in the SMILES: CCCCC...COC[C@H](COP(...))OC(=O)... 

In this case, the structure is C-O-P, so the SMARTS should match both possibilities. However, SMARTS is exact, so we need a pattern that can match either scenario.

But how can a single SMARTS pattern match both C-O-P and O-P? It can't unless we use alternations. Alternatively, create a SMARTS that allows for either connectivity.

Wait, no. The correct structure for sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine has the phosphate attached to the third carbon via an oxygen. So the third carbon (the one with the phosphate) is connected as CH2-O-P. Therefore, the SMARTS should have that oxygen.

In the example where the SMILES starts with P(...), the structure is O-P connected to the chiral center's carbon. Wait, no. Let's parse that SMILES:

SMILES: P(OC[C@@H](COCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)OC(=O)...)... 

The P is connected to three oxygens: one connected to the chiral center (OC[...]), one double-bonded O, and one connected to the choline (OCC...).

So the chiral center's carbon is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the phosphorus. So the structure is C-O-P. Therefore, the SMARTS should have C-O-P, not C-O-P directly attached.

Wait, the correct structure for the sn-3 position is CH2-OPO3-choline. So the oxygen is between the carbon and the phosphorus. Therefore, the SMARTS should have C-O-P.

In the previous code's SMARTS, it was written as COP(=O)... which implies C-O-P. But in the example SMILES where the phosphate is written as P(OC[...]), the connection is O-P, which is the same as C-O-P. So the SMARTS should still match.

Wait, in SMILES notation, the order of atoms matters. The SMILES "COP(=O)..." represents C-O-P. The SMILES "P(OC[...])(...)" also represents O-P, but the oxygen is connected to the carbon. So in both cases, the connection is C-O-P. The difference is in how the SMILES is written, but the actual structure is the same.

Therefore, the core SMARTS should match C-O-P regardless of how it's written in the SMILES. The previous SMARTS might have failed because it was too specific in the order of the atoms around the phosphorus.

To account for different SMILES representations of the phosphate group, the SMARTS should use a more flexible pattern for the phosphate. For example, using "P(=[O])([O-])(OCC[N+](C)(C)C)O" to allow any order of the oxygen atoms around the phosphorus.

Alternatively, using a SMARTS that matches any arrangement of the phosphate group as long as it's connected to the oxygen from the glycerol.

Putting this all together, the corrected core SMARTS should be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P](=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

But wait, in some examples, the phosphate is connected as COP..., so the SMARTS should also match that. The difference between COP(=O)... and O[P]... is the connectivity. However, in reality, both represent the same structure (C-O-P), just written differently in SMILES.

This suggests that the previous SMARTS was too strict in the way the phosphate is connected. To fix this, the SMARTS should allow the phosphate to be connected via an oxygen, regardless of the SMILES notation.

Therefore, the core SMARTS should be written to match the oxygen connected to the chiral center, which is then connected to the phosphate group. The corrected SMARTS would be:

[C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P](=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C

This should match both cases where the phosphate is written as COP... or P(OC...).

Testing this with the example SMILES that starts with P(...):

The SMILES is P(OC[C@@H](COCCCC...)...), which would have the O connected to the chiral center and then to P. The SMARTS [C@H](COC)(OC(=O))O[P]... should match this because the chiral center has an O connected to P.

Another example SMILES: CCCCC...COC[C@H](COP(...))... would have the O connected to P directly (COP), which would also match the SMARTS because the O is part of the P group.

Therefore, adjusting the core SMARTS to this pattern should fix the matching issue.

Additionally, the previous code had checks for the ether and ester groups, but if the core SMARTS wasn't matching, those checks were skipped. By fixing the core SMARTS, those subsequent checks can proceed.

Another potential issue is the handling of charges. The previous SMARTS included [O-] and [N+], which should be correct. However, in some SMILES, the charges might be represented differently, but the examples seem to use the same notation.

Now, let's revise the code with the corrected core SMARTS and adjust the subsequent checks.

The function should:

1. Parse the SMILES.
2. Check for the core structure with the corrected SMARTS.
3. Verify the sn-1 ether is an alkyl chain.
4. Verify the sn-2 ester is an acyl chain.
5. Check molecular weight (optional, but might help filter small molecules).

Testing this approach should resolve the core SMARTS issue and allow the function to correctly identify the examples.
