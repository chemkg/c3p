</think>

Okay, I need to create a function called is_triglyceride that checks if a SMILES string represents a triglyceride. From the previous attempt, there was an indentation error, so I need to make sure the code is properly formatted. Let me think about the structure of a triglyceride. It's a glycerol backbone (propane-1,2,3-triol) where all three hydroxyl groups are esterified with fatty acids. 

First, I should parse the SMILES into a molecule. If that fails, return False. Then, check for the glycerol backbone. The glycerol should have three oxygen atoms connected in a specific way. Maybe using a SMARTS pattern like [CH2]([OH])[CH]([OH])[CH2]([OH]) but after esterification, the OHs become ester groups. Wait, noâ€”after esterification, the OHs are replaced by O-C(=O)-R groups. So the glycerol backbone would be O-C-C-O-C-C-O, but actually, it's more like a central CH2 connected to two other CH2 groups, each with ester links.

Maybe a SMARTS pattern for the glycerol backbone after esterification. Let me think: the central carbon (CH) connected to two CH2 groups, each attached to an oxygen that's part of an ester. So maybe something like [CH2]-[CH](-[CH2])-O-C(=O)-*. But that might not capture all cases. Alternatively, look for three ester groups (-O-C(=O)-) attached to a glycerol-like structure.

Next, check that there are exactly three ester groups. Then, ensure each ester is connected to a sufficiently long carbon chain (like at least 8 carbons for a fatty acid). Maybe count the number of carbons in each chain. Alternatively, check the molecular weight or number of rotatable bonds as a proxy for chain length.

Wait, in the previous example, they checked for three ester groups, glycerol backbone, and then some chain length via rotatable bonds and molecular weight. But maybe the previous code had issues with the SMARTS patterns or the logic flow.

Let me structure the steps:

1. Parse the SMILES. If invalid, return False.
2. Check for the presence of a glycerol backbone. Maybe a SMARTS pattern that matches the central glycerol structure with three ester groups.
3. Ensure there are exactly three ester groups.
4. Verify that each ester is connected to a fatty acid chain (long enough, maybe at least 8 carbons).
5. Additional checks like molecular weight or oxygen count could help avoid false positives.

Possible issues in the previous code: The SMARTS patterns for glycerol backbone might not correctly identify the structure after esterification. Also, checking for three ester groups is crucial. The fatty acid chain check might be too strict or not accurate enough.

So, adjusting the SMARTS patterns. For the glycerol backbone, maybe [CH2](-[OX2])-[CH](-[OX2])-[CH2](-[OX2]) where each OX2 is part of an ester. Wait, but in the ester, the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl. So the actual structure would be O-C(=O)-R. So the glycerol's oxygen atoms are connected to carbonyl groups. Maybe the SMARTS should look for three ester groups attached to the three hydroxyl positions of glycerol.

Alternatively, the glycerol backbone after esterification would have three ester groups. So the SMARTS could be:

[C]([OX2][C]=O)([OX2][C]=O)([OX2][C]=O) but that's not correct because the central carbon is CH. Maybe:

[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])

But that might be too rigid. Alternatively, find a central carbon connected to three oxygen atoms that are each part of ester groups.

Alternatively, use a more flexible approach: find three ester groups and check if they're all attached to a glycerol-like structure.

So, the plan is:

- Check for three ester groups.
- Check that all three esters are attached to a glycerol backbone (three adjacent carbons, each with an ester oxygen).
- Check that each ester's acid part has a sufficiently long chain.

Implementing this with RDKit's SMARTS patterns.

Another thing: the previous code had a glycerol_pattern as [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4], which might not account for the ester attachments. Maybe that's why it failed. So I need a better SMARTS to find the glycerol backbone with esters.

Let me define the glycerol backbone with three ester groups. The glycerol would be O-C-C-O-C-C-O, but in the molecule, the oxygens are part of esters. So the structure is:

CH2-O-C(=O)-R
|
CH-O-C(=O)-R
|
CH2-O-C(=O)-R

So the central CH is connected to two CH2 groups, each with an ester. The SMARTS could be:

[CH2](-[OX2]-[C](=[OX1])-[*])[CH](-[OX2]-[C](=[OX1])-[*])[CH2](-[OX2]-[C](=[OX1])-[*])

This pattern should match the glycerol backbone with three ester groups. Let's test this.

Then, check that there are exactly three ester groups. Wait, if the SMARTS already matches three esters attached to glycerol, then maybe just checking for that substructure is sufficient. Additionally, verify that each ester's R group is a long chain.

But how to check the chain length? Maybe for each ester group, traverse the chain from the carbonyl carbon and count the number of carbons. If any chain has less than, say, 8 carbons, it's not a fatty acid.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches chains of sufficient length. For example, a chain of at least 7 carbons (since the carbonyl is one, then 7 more would make 8 total). But this might be complex.

Alternatively, after finding the ester groups, check the length of the attached alkyl chains. For each ester group (O-C(=O)-R), the R should be a long alkyl chain. So, for each match of the ester group, follow the R group and count the carbons.

But how to implement this in RDKit? For each ester oxygen, get the neighboring carbonyl carbon, then follow the next atom (the R group). Then traverse the chain from there, counting carbons.

This could be done by for each ester in the molecule, check if the attached chain is long enough. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches the ester group followed by a chain of at least a certain length. For example, the ester group with a chain of 8 or more carbons: [OX2][C](=[OX1])[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]. But this might not account for branches or double bonds.

Hmm, maybe this approach is too rigid. Instead, for each ester group, check the number of carbons in the R group. Let's see.

Another approach: Calculate the total number of carbons in the molecule. Triglycerides typically have a high number of carbons (like 50+). But this might vary. However, the previous example used a check for molecular weight over 500, which might be reasonable.

Putting it all together:

1. Check SMILES is valid.
2. Check for the presence of the glycerol backbone with three ester groups using a SMARTS pattern.
3. Ensure there are exactly three ester groups.
4. Check that each ester's R group has a minimum length (maybe at least 4 carbons, but fatty acids are usually longer).
5. Check molecular weight is above a threshold.

Wait, but the examples include TG(8:0/14:0/i-22:0), which has a short chain (8:0 is octanoic acid, 8 carbons). So maybe the minimum chain length is around 8 carbons.

But how to check each chain's length? Let's think. For each ester group (O-C(=O)-R), R is the fatty acid chain. The carbonyl carbon is part of the ester, so the chain starts from the next carbon. For example, in octanoic acid, the chain after the carbonyl is 7 carbons (since the acid is CH3(CH2)6COOH). So the R group in the ester would be -(CH2)6CH3. So the chain length from the ester is 7 carbons. But octanoic acid has 8 carbons in total. So perhaps checking that the R group has at least 4 carbons (for shorter chains) might not be sufficient. Alternatively, require that each chain has at least 4 carbons (so total 5 including the carbonyl).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check that the total number of carbons in the molecule is at least, say, 30, which would be reasonable for three fatty acids (each at least 8 carbons: 3*8=24, plus glycerol's 3 carbons and oxygens, so total around 27, but maybe higher). The molecular weight check in the previous example was 500, which for a triglyceride with three C18 chains would be about 890 g/mol. So maybe the molecular weight check is too strict. Alternatively, use a lower threshold.

Alternatively, skip checking individual chain lengths and rely on the presence of three esters attached to glycerol and the total number of carbons or molecular weight.

But to cover all cases, perhaps the main checks are:

- Glycerol backbone with three ester groups.
- Three ester groups present.
- Each ester group is connected to a chain that's at least a certain length.

But implementing the chain length check is tricky. Maybe instead of checking each chain, just check the total number of carbons. For example, triglycerides have at least 3 (glycerol) + 3*8 (each fatty acid) = 27 carbons. But some triglycerides might have shorter chains. However, the examples include TG(8:0/14:0/i-22:0), which has an 8-carbon chain. So maybe the minimum is 8 per chain. But how to enforce that.

Alternatively, the previous code's approach of checking the number of rotatable bonds might not be reliable. Maybe instead, after confirming the three esters and glycerol structure, assume that the molecule is a triglyceride. But this could lead to false positives.

Given the complexity, perhaps the main checks are:

1. Valid SMILES.
2. Presence of glycerol backbone with three ester groups (using a SMARTS pattern).
3. Exactly three ester groups.
4. Molecular weight over a certain threshold (like 300).

But I need to test this.

The previous code had a SMARTS pattern for glycerol as [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4], which might not account for the ester attachments. So the correct SMARTS should include the ester groups.

Let me define the glycerol backbone with three ester groups. The SMARTS could be:

[CH2](-[OX2]-[C]=O)-[CH](-[OX2]-[C]=O)-[CH2](-[OX2]-[C]=O)

This should match the central CH connected to two CH2 groups, each with an ester group. But wait, the actual structure is:

O-C(=O)-R connected to each CH2 and CH.

Alternatively, the SMARTS pattern should be:

[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])

This pattern looks for a central CH atom connected to two CH2 groups, each with an oxygen connected to a carbonyl group. The [*] represents any atom, so the R group.

If this SMARTS matches, then the molecule has the glycerol backbone with three ester groups.

So in code:

glycerol_ester_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])")

If this pattern is found, then it's a triglyceride.

Additionally, check that there are exactly three ester groups. Wait, the pattern already requires three esters attached to glycerol. So maybe checking for this pattern is sufficient.

But some molecules might have more than three ester groups, but the pattern would still match. However, if the molecule has exactly three esters all attached to glycerol, then it's a triglyceride.

Alternatively, the pattern might not match if there are substituents elsewhere. But assuming that the SMARTS is specific enough.

So the steps would be:

- Check if the molecule has the glycerol backbone with three esters (using the SMARTS).
- If yes, return True; else, False.

But this might miss some cases or include others. For example, if there's a glycerol with three esters plus another ester elsewhere, the SMARTS would still match the glycerol part, but the molecule isn't a triglyceride. So to avoid that, also check that the total number of ester groups is exactly three.

So:

1. Parse SMILES.
2. Check for invalid SMILES.
3. Find all ester groups ([OX2][C](=O)).
4. Check there are exactly three.
5. Check that the glycerol backbone with three esters is present.
6. Return True if both conditions are met.

This would ensure that there are exactly three esters, all attached to the glycerol.

So putting this into code:

from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem
from rdkit.Chem import rdMolDescriptors

def is_triglyceride(smiles: str):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if mol is None:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES"
    
    # Check for three ester groups
    ester_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[OX2][C](=[OX1])")
    ester_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(ester_pattern)
    if len(ester_matches) != 3:
        return False, f"Found {len(ester_matches)} ester groups, expected 3"
    
    # Check glycerol backbone with three esters
    glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH]([OX2][C](=O)[*])[CH2]([OX2][C](=O)[*])")
    if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(glycerol_pattern):
        return False, "Glycerol backbone with three esters not found"
    
    # Optional: Check molecular weight (e.g., > 500)
    mol_wt = rdMolDescriptors.CalcExactMolWt(mol)
    if mol_wt < 500:
        return False, f"Molecular weight too low ({mol_wt:.1f} < 500)"
    
    return True, "Triglyceride with three ester groups on glycerol backbone"

This code first checks for exactly three ester groups, then verifies that they are all attached to a glycerol backbone. The molecular weight check is optional but helps exclude smaller molecules. However, some triglycerides with shorter chains might have lower weights, so the weight check could be adjusted or removed. For example, triacetin (a triester of glycerol and acetic acid) has a molecular weight of 218.2, which is much lower than 500. But triacetin is not considered a triglyceride in the biological sense, as the fatty acids must be long-chain. Hence, the molecular weight check helps exclude such cases.

Testing this code with the provided examples should work if the SMARTS pattern correctly identifies the glycerol backbone with three esters. The previous error was due to incorrect indentation, which is fixed here.
