Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The false positives and negatives suggest issues in both the aldehyde chain checking and hemiacetal detection.

First, the false positives like erythro-Tetrodialdose have two aldehyde groups, which the original code didn't check for. Aldoses should have only one aldehyde. So I need to ensure there's exactly one aldehyde group.

Next, the code's adjacent_oh_count check might not be correctly tracking the polyhydroxy chain. The original code checks neighbors of the aldehyde's carbon, but maybe it's not following the chain properly. The definition says H[CH(OH)]nC(=O)H with n ≥2. So there should be a chain of CH(OH) groups between the aldehyde and the terminal CH2OH (or similar). Maybe using a SMARTS pattern that captures this sequence would be better.

For the cyclic hemiacetals, the previous pattern [C;r][OH]-[O;r] might not capture the correct structure. Hemiacetals in aldoses typically form when the aldehyde reacts with a hydroxyl group further down the chain. The cyclic form should have an oxygen in the ring connected to the hemiacetal carbon (the former aldehyde carbon). Also, in aldoses, the hemiacetal carbon (anomeric carbon) is connected to one oxygen in the ring and one hydroxyl group. So maybe a SMARTS pattern like [C]([OH])O[C] where the carbon is in a ring would work better.

The false negatives indicate that the code missed both open-chain aldehydes and cyclic forms. For example, aldehydo-L-glucose has the aldehyde but maybe the adjacent_oh_count wasn't calculated correctly. The original code counts adjacent OHs by looking at neighbors of the aldehyde carbon's neighbors, which might not follow the chain properly.

Let me adjust the approach:

1. **Aldehyde Check:**
   - Ensure exactly one aldehyde group.
   - Verify that the aldehyde is at the end of a chain with at least two CH(OH) groups before a terminal CH2OH (or similar).

2. **Cyclic Hemiacetal Check:**
   - Look for a ring oxygen connected to a carbon that has an -OH group (hemiacetal formation).
   - Ensure the hemiacetal carbon (anomeric) has one bond to oxygen in the ring and one hydroxyl.

3. **Handling Multiple Aldehydes:**
   - Reject molecules with more than one aldehyde group.

4. **SMARTS Patterns:**
   - For open chain: Use a pattern like [CH2OH]-[CH(OH)]n-[CH](=O) where n ≥2.
   - For cyclic: Use a pattern that captures the hemiacetal structure, maybe [C]([OH])O-[C@H] in a ring.

Let me try implementing these changes. For the open chain, a SMARTS pattern like [CH2OH]-[CH(OH)]{2,}-[CH](=O) might work. But SMARTS can be tricky for variable lengths. Alternatively, check that the aldehyde is connected to a chain of at least two CH(OH) groups leading to a CH2OH.

For the cyclic form, the hemiacetal carbon should be connected to both an -OH and a ring oxygen. A SMARTS pattern like [C;r]([OH])O[C;r] could capture this. Also, the ring size should be 5 or 6 (furanose or pyranose).

Testing these adjustments should reduce false positives by ensuring proper chain structure and hemiacetal detection, and catch the missed examples by improving pattern matching.
