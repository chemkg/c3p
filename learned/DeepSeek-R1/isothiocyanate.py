</think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create a function called is_isothiocyanate that checks if a given SMILES string represents an isothiocyanate. The definition says it's an organosulfur compound with the general formula R-N=C=S. 

First, I should think about the structural features. The key part is the N=C=S group connected to some organic group R. So, the molecule must have a substructure where a nitrogen is double-bonded to a carbon, which is then double-bonded to a sulfur. That's the isothiocyanate group.

Using RDKit, I can parse the SMILES and look for this specific group. Maybe a SMARTS pattern would work here. The SMARTS for N=C=S would be [N]=[C]=[S]. But wait, in SMILES, the order matters. The actual connectivity is N-C-S with double bonds. So the correct SMARTS should be [N]=C=S. Wait, no, the actual structure is N=C=S, so the SMARTS should be [N]=[C]=[S]. Let me confirm. In the isothiocyanate group, the nitrogen is connected to the carbon via a double bond, and the carbon is connected to sulfur via another double bond. So the correct pattern is [N]=[C]=[S].

But wait, in SMILES notation, the order of atoms matters. So maybe the SMARTS should be [N]=C=S. Let me think. For example, allyl isothiocyanate is C=CCN=C=S. The N is connected to C (from the chain) and then double-bonded to C, which is double-bonded to S. So the SMARTS pattern should match that. So the correct pattern is [N]=C=S. But wait, in SMARTS, the double bonds are specified. So [N]=[C]=[S] would require two double bonds, which is correct because N is double-bonded to C, and C is double-bonded to S. So the SMARTS should be [N]=[C]=[S].

But wait, in SMILES, the order is N-C-S with double bonds. So the actual structure is N=C=S. So the SMARTS pattern would be [N]=C=S. Hmm, maybe I need to represent the connectivity correctly. Let me check an example. For methyl isothiocyanate, the SMILES is CN=C=S. The structure is CH3-N=C=S. So the N is connected to the methyl group (single bond), then double bond to C, which is double bond to S. So the SMARTS should be [N]=[C]=[S], but connected in sequence. Wait, in SMARTS, the atoms are connected in the order they appear. So [N]=C=S would mean N connected to C with a double bond, and C connected to S with a single bond. But in reality, it's a double bond between C and S. So the correct SMARTS is [N]=[C]=[S]. But how to represent that in SMARTS? Because in SMARTS, each bond is specified between atoms. So the correct pattern would be [N]=[C]=[S]. Let me verify this with RDKit.

Alternatively, maybe the SMARTS should be [N]=C=S, but that would imply a single bond between C and S. Wait, no. In SMARTS, the '=' denotes a double bond. So to have N=C=S with double bonds between N-C and C-S, the SMARTS should be [N]=[C]=[S]. But in SMILES notation, the C=S is written as =S, so the SMARTS should correctly capture that. So the correct SMARTS pattern is [N]=[C]=[S].

But wait, when I write [N]=[C]=[S], that would require the three atoms to be connected in a row with double bonds. But in reality, the structure is N=C=S, which is a linear arrangement of N-C-S with double bonds between each pair. So the SMARTS should be [N]=C=S. Wait, no. Because in SMILES, the C is double bonded to both N and S. So the correct SMARTS is [N]=[C]=[S]. But how does that work in terms of connectivity? Each atom is connected by a double bond. So the pattern is N=C=S with both bonds being double. So in SMARTS, that's [N]=[C]=[S].

Testing this with RDKit: if I create a molecule from SMILES like 'CN=C=S' (methyl isothiocyanate), and then search for the SMARTS pattern '[N]=[C]=[S]', will it find a match? Let's see. The molecule has the N connected to C (methyl), then the C is double bonded to S. Wait, no. The SMILES is CN=C=S. So the N is connected to the methyl C via a single bond, then the next C is double bonded to S. So the structure is CH3-N-C=S. Wait, no. The correct structure of isothiocyanate is R-N=C=S, where the N is double bonded to the C, which is double bonded to S. So the SMILES should be C[N]=C=S. Wait, but in the example given, methyl isothiocyanate is CN=C=S. Let me parse that. The SMILES is C-N=C=S. So the N is connected to the methyl C (single bond), then the N is double bonded to the next C, which is double bonded to S. So the structure is CH3-N=C=S. So the N has a single bond to the methyl group and a double bond to the central C, which is double bonded to S. So the SMARTS pattern should match N=C=S, but the N is connected to the R group via a single bond.

Wait, the general structure is R-N=C=S. So the N is connected to R (single bond) and to C (double bond), and C is connected to S (double bond). So the SMARTS pattern should be [NX3][CX2]=[SX1]. Wait, maybe considering the valence. The nitrogen here is likely to have three bonds: one to R, and two in the double bond to C. So the nitrogen would have a valence of 3. The carbon in the middle (C) is double bonded to N and S, so it has two double bonds, making its valence 4 (each double bond counts as two). Wait, that's not possible. Wait, the central carbon is bonded to N (double bond) and S (double bond), so two double bonds. That's a total of four bonds, which is okay. So the SMARTS pattern would be [N]=[C]=[S]. But in the actual molecule, the N is connected to R (single bond) and to C (double bond). So the N has three bonds: single to R, double to C. So the SMARTS should be [N]([#6])=[C]=[S]. That way, the N is bonded to a carbon (the R group) with a single bond and double bonded to the C, which is double bonded to S.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMARTS can be written as [NX3]=[CX2]=[SX1], where N has three bonds (including the double bond), C has two bonds (double to N and double to S), and S has one bond (double to C). But I'm not sure about the valence here. Maybe it's better to focus on the connectivity rather than the valence. So the pattern is [N]=C=S, but with the C having a double bond to both N and S. Wait, that's not possible in SMARTS because each bond is between two atoms. So the correct way is [N]=[C]=[S], which represents N connected to C with a double bond, and C connected to S with a double bond. That should match the N=C=S group.

So, in RDKit, using the SMARTS pattern '[N]=[C]=[S]' should find the isothiocyanate group. Let's test this with the example SMILES 'CN=C=S'. Parsing this SMILES, the molecule would have the structure CH3-N-C=S. Wait, no. The SMILES is C-N=C=S. So the N is connected to the methyl C (single bond), then double bonded to the next C, which is double bonded to S. Wait, that can't be right. Because in SMILES, the order matters. The SMILES 'CN=C=S' would be parsed as C-N=C=S, which implies that the N is connected to C (from the methyl) with a single bond, then the N is double bonded to another C, which is double bonded to S. But that would make the structure CH3-N=C=S. Wait, but that's correct. The N is connected to the methyl group (single bond) and double bonded to the C, which is double bonded to S. So the SMARTS pattern [N]=[C]=[S] would match the N-C-S part with double bonds. So in this case, the N is part of the N=C=S group, connected to R (methyl).

So, the SMARTS pattern should correctly identify the N=C=S group. So in the code, I can search for this pattern. If there's at least one match, then it's an isothiocyanate. But wait, there might be other groups that have N=C=S, but not as the main functional group. But according to the definition, any organosulfur compound with R-N=C=S is an isothiocyanate, regardless of the R group. So as long as the N=C=S group is present and connected to some organic group, it should be considered.

But wait, the definition says "organosulfur compound", which implies that the compound must have at least one carbon atom (organic). So the R group must be an organic substituent, not just a hydrogen. So the N must be connected to a carbon atom (not hydrogen). So the SMARTS pattern should ensure that the N is connected to a carbon. So perhaps the SMARTS should be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S]. But wait, that might not capture all cases. For example, if the R group is a benzene ring (like phenyl isothiocyanate: S=C=Nc1ccccc1), the N is connected to the benzene ring (a carbon in the ring). So the SMARTS pattern should be [C] connected to N, which is double bonded to C and S.

Alternatively, the SMARTS could be [C][N]=[C]=[S], which would match any N=C=S group where the N is attached to a carbon. But in some cases, the R group might be a more complex structure. For example, in 1-naphthyl isothiocyanate (S=C=Nc1cccc2ccccc12), the N is connected to a naphthyl group. The SMARTS [C][N]=[C]=[S] would still match because the N is attached to a carbon in the naphthyl group.

So the plan is:

1. Check that the SMILES is valid.
2. Check that the molecule contains the N=C=S group, where the N is connected to a carbon (i.e., the N is not a terminal group like in HN=C=S, which would be thiocyanic acid, not an organosulfur compound).
3. Ensure that the N is bonded to at least one carbon atom (to exclude HN=C=S).

So the SMARTS pattern should be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S]. Wait, but in SMARTS, the hyphen represents a single bond. So [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match a carbon single-bonded to N, which is double-bonded to C, which is double-bonded to S. That seems correct. But in the case of phenyl isothiocyanate (S=C=Nc1ccccc1), the N is connected to the benzene ring's carbon via a single bond, then double-bonded to C and S. So the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match that.

But wait, the SMILES for phenyl isothiocyanate is S=C=Nc1ccccc1. The structure is S=C=N-C6H5. So the N is connected to the benzene ring's carbon with a single bond and to the C (from C=S) with a double bond. So the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match the N connected to a carbon (from the benzene) and double bonded to the C which is double bonded to S.

Yes, that should work. So the SMARTS pattern would be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S].

Wait, but in the SMILES 'CN=C=S' (methyl isothiocyanate), the structure is CH3-N=C=S. The N is connected to the methyl C (single bond) and to the C (double bond). So the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match the methyl C connected to N, which is double bonded to C and S. So that's correct.

Another example: allyl isothiocyanate (C=CCN=C=S). The SMILES is C=CC-N=C=S. The N is connected to the allyl group's terminal C (single bond), then double bonded to C and S. The SMARTS would match.

But wait, the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] requires that the N is connected to a carbon (single bond), then double bonded to another carbon and sulfur. Wait, no. The SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would require the N to have a single bond to a carbon and double bonds to two other atoms (C and S), which is not possible because a nitrogen can't have three bonds with two double bonds. Wait, nitrogen typically has three bonds. So in the isothiocyanate group, the nitrogen is bonded to R (single bond), and double bonded to the carbon (which is double bonded to sulfur). So the nitrogen has two bonds: one single and one double. Wait, that's only two bonds. That's not possible. Nitrogen usually has three bonds. Oh wait, in the isothiocyanate group, the nitrogen is actually bonded to the carbon (from R) with a single bond, and then double bonded to the central carbon, which is double bonded to sulfur. So the nitrogen has two bonds: single and double. But that would leave nitrogen with a lone pair, making it a valid structure. Wait, but nitrogen typically has three bonds and one lone pair in such cases. Hmm, maybe the actual structure is R-N=C=S with the nitrogen having a double bond to carbon and a single bond to R, totaling two bonds. That would imply a charge, but isothiocyanates are neutral. So perhaps the actual structure involves resonance, but in any case, the SMILES representation is R-N=C=S.

But in terms of SMARTS matching, the pattern [N]=C=S would capture the N=C=S group. However, we need to ensure that the N is connected to a carbon (R group). So the SMARTS should be [C]-[N]=C=S. Let's think again. The correct SMARTS would be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S], but that requires the N to be bonded to two carbons and a sulfur, which isn't the case. Wait, no. The structure is R-N=C=S. So the N is bonded to R (C), and double bonded to C, which is double bonded to S. So the SMARTS should be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S]. But in this case, the N is bonded to C (R group) via a single bond and to the central C via a double bond. The central C is bonded to S via a double bond. So the SMARTS would be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S]. However, this SMARTS pattern would require four atoms in a row: C-N-C-S, each connected by the specified bonds. But in reality, the structure is N connected to R (C) and to the central C (double bond), which is connected to S (double bond). So the SMARTS should be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S]. But in the molecule, the atoms are arranged as R-N=C=S, which is a linear arrangement. So the SMARTS pattern [N]=[C]=[S] would match the N=C=S part, and then we need to check that the N is connected to a carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMARTS can be written as [C][N]=[C]=[S], which ensures that the N is attached to a carbon. Let's test this with an example. For methyl isothiocyanate (CN=C=S), the SMARTS [C][N]=[C]=[S] would match the C-N=C=S part. Yes. For phenyl isothiocyanate (S=C=Nc1ccccc1), the SMILES is S=C=N-C1... So the N is attached to a carbon in the benzene ring. The SMARTS [C][N]=[C]=[S] would match the N attached to the benzene carbon, then double bonded to C and S. So that works.

But wait, the SMILES for phenyl isothiocyanate is actually N=C=S connected to the benzene ring. So the SMILES is c1ccccc1N=C=S. Wait, no. The correct SMILES is S=C=Nc1ccccc1. So the N is connected to the benzene ring's carbon. So in the molecule, the N is attached to a carbon (from the benzene) via a single bond and to the C (from C=S) via a double bond. So the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match that.

Therefore, the steps for the function are:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule. If invalid, return False.
2. Check if the molecule contains the substructure [C]-[N]=[C]=[S].
3. Also, ensure that the N in this group is bonded to at least one carbon (which the SMARTS already ensures).
4. Additionally, check that the group is present at least once.

But wait, maybe the SMARTS can be simplified. Since the definition is R-N=C=S, the key is the N=C=S group with the N connected to any carbon (R). So the SMARTS could be [N]=[C]=[S] where the N is connected to a carbon. So perhaps the SMARTS should be [C]-[N]=[C]=[S], but maybe that's too restrictive. Alternatively, use [N]=[C]=[S] and then check that the N is bonded to at least one carbon.

So the approach could be:

- Find all occurrences of the N=C=S group using the SMARTS [N]=[C]=[S].
- For each match, check if the N is bonded to at least one carbon atom (not hydrogen or other elements).

But how to do that in RDKit? Maybe after finding the N=C=S groups, check the neighbors of the N atom to see if any are carbons.

Alternatively, include that in the SMARTS pattern. The SMARTS could be [C][N]=[C]=[S], which ensures that the N is bonded to a carbon.

Wait, but in the SMARTS [C][N]=[C]=[S], the N is bonded to a carbon (from the R group) and to the C (from the C=S). So the N has two bonds: one to R (C) and one to C (double bond). But nitrogen typically has three bonds. So maybe the SMARTS should account for that. However, in the case of isothiocyanates, the nitrogen has a single bond to R (C), a double bond to the central C, and a lone pair. So valence-wise, it's acceptable.

But perhaps the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] is sufficient. Let's test this with some examples.

Test case 1: methyl isothiocyanate (CN=C=S). The SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would match the C (methyl) connected to N via single bond, N connected to C (central) via double bond, which is connected to S via double bond. Yes.

Test case 2: phenyl isothiocyanate (N=C=Sc1ccccc1, but actual SMILES is S=C=Nc1ccccc1). The SMARTS would match the benzene C connected to N, which is double bonded to C and S. Yes.

Test case 3: HN=C=S (thiocyanic acid, not an isothiocyanate). The SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] would not match because the N is connected to H, not C. So this would correctly be excluded.

Another test case: ethyl isothiocyanate (CCN=C=S). The SMARTS would match the C (from ethyl) connected to N, etc.

So the SMARTS [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] seems to correctly identify the isothiocyanate group where N is attached to a carbon.

But wait, in the SMILES for allyl isothiocyanate (C=CCN=C=S), the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-N=C=S. The N is attached to the CH2 group (carbon), so the SMARTS would match.

Another example: (S)-sulforaphane (N(=C=S)CCCC[S@@](=O)C). The SMILES includes N(=C=S), which is N connected to C=S and another group. Wait, the SMILES is N(=C=S)CCCC... So the N has two double bonds? Wait, no. In SMILES, the notation N(=C=S) means the N is double bonded to the C, which is then bonded to S. But that would imply N has a double bond to C, and C has a single bond to S. But in reality, the structure is N=C=S. So perhaps the SMILES is written as N=C=S. Wait, the given SMILES for (S)-sulforaphane is N(=C=S)CCCC[S@@](=O)C. So the N is double bonded to C, which is single bonded to S. That's not correct. Wait, no. In SMILES, the = indicates double bonds. So N(=C=S) would mean N double bonded to C, and C single bonded to S. But that's not the correct structure for isothiocyanate. The correct structure is N=C=S, with double bonds between N-C and C-S. So perhaps the SMILES should be written as N=C=S. But in the given example, the SMILES is N(=C=S)..., which might be a different representation. Wait, maybe the SMILES parser interprets N(=C=S) as N double bonded to C, which is single bonded to S. That would not be correct. So perhaps the given example is incorrect, or maybe the SMILES is written differently.

Alternatively, maybe the SMILES for sulforaphane is correctly written as N(=C=S)..., which would imply that the N is double bonded to C, and the C is single bonded to S. But that's not the correct structure. The correct structure should have C double bonded to S. So the correct SMILES would be N=C=S. But in the given example, it's written as N(=C=S). Hmm, this might be a problem. Let me check the actual structure of sulforaphane. Sulforaphane has the group -N=C=S, so the SMILES should be N=C=S. But in the given example, the SMILES is N(=C=S)CCCC[S@@](=O)C. So the N is double bonded to C, which is single bonded to S. That would be a thiocyanate (S-C≡N), but the isothiocyanate is N=C=S. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is correct. Let me parse it: N(=C=S) means the N is double bonded to C, and the C is bonded to S. So the structure is N=C-S. But that's a single bond between C and S. That's not correct for isothiocyanate. Isothiocyanate should have N=C=S with double bonds. So perhaps the given example is incorrect, or maybe the SMILES is written in a way that the double bond is between C and S. Wait, in SMILES, the = symbol applies to the previous bond. So in N(=C=S), the N is double bonded to C, and the C is single bonded to S. That's not correct. The correct SMILES for the isothiocyanate group should be N=C=S, which is parsed as N double bonded to C, which is double bonded to S. So the correct SMILES for the isothiocyanate group is N=C=S, and the SMARTS [N]=[C]=[S] would match that.

But in the given example for sulforaphane, the SMILES is N(=C=S)..., which may not represent the correct structure. This could be a mistake in the example, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the SMILES notation. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as N=C=S, which would be correct. For example, methyl isothiocyanate is CN=C=S, which parses as C-N=C=S, with the N double bonded to C and C double bonded to S. So the SMARTS [N]=[C]=[S] would match that.

So, the plan is:

- Use the SMARTS pattern [N]=[C]=[S] to find the N=C=S group.
- Check that the nitrogen in this group is bonded to at least one carbon atom (to exclude HN=C=S).

So the steps in code would be:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule. If invalid, return False and reason.
2. Find all matches of the SMARTS pattern [N]=[C]=[S].
3. For each matched nitrogen in these groups, check if it has at least one neighboring carbon atom.
4. If any such group exists, return True with the reason. Otherwise, return False.

Implementing this in RDKit:

- The SMARTS pattern can be created as Chem.MolFromSmarts('[N]=[C]=[S]').
- For each match, get the indices of the N, C, S atoms.
- Check the neighbors of the N atom to see if any are carbons.

Alternatively, include the requirement in the SMARTS pattern that the N is connected to a carbon. So the SMARTS would be '[C]-[N]=[C]=[S]'. This ensures that the N is bonded to a carbon.

Testing this SMARTS pattern with various examples:

- Methyl isothiocyanate (CN=C=S): matches [C]-[N]=[C]=[S].
- Phenyl isothiocyanate (S=C=Nc1ccccc1): the N is connected to a carbon in the benzene ring, so matches.
- Allyl isothiocyanate (C=CCN=C=S): the N is connected to a carbon in the allyl group, so matches.
- HN=C=S: does not match because the N is connected to H, not C.

This seems to cover the cases correctly.

So the code can be structured as follows:

- Check if the molecule has at least one match to the SMARTS pattern '[C]-[N]=[C]=[S]'.
- If yes, return True and the reason.
- Otherwise, return False and the appropriate reason.

Additionally, we should handle cases where the SMILES is invalid.

Another thing to consider: the isothiocyanate group is R-N=C=S, where R is any organic substituent. The SMARTS pattern [C]-[N]=[C]=[S] ensures that the N is connected to a carbon (R), so this should cover all valid cases.

Now, implementing this in code:

The function is_isothiocyanate will take a SMILES string, parse it into a molecule, check for the presence of the SMARTS pattern
