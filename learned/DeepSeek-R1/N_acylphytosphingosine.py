Okay, let's try to figure out why the previous code didn't work. The error mentioned was an "unexpected indent" in line 1. Looking at the previous code, I notice that the user provided a list of SMILES examples, but the code they tried to run was actually just a list of SMILES strings, not valid Python code. The assistant must have mistakenly included those SMILES as part of the code block instead of properly writing the function.

So, the main issue was that the previous code wasn't valid Python. The function wasn't properly structured. Now, I need to create the correct function for is_N_acylphytosphingosine.

First, the definition says it's a ceramide which is phytosphingosine with a fatty acyl group attached to the nitrogen. Phytosphingosine has a specific structure: a sphingoid base with three hydroxyl groups and an amino group. The N-acyl part means a fatty acid is attached via an amide bond to the nitrogen.

Steps to check:
1. Check for the phytosphingosine backbone: a long chain with three hydroxyl groups and an amino group attached.
2. Look for an amide group (N attached to a carbonyl group) as the fatty acyl attachment.
3. Ensure the fatty acyl group is a long chain (probably at least 12 carbons or so).

Possible RDKit steps:
- Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
- Check for the presence of an amide group (NC(=O)).
- Find the nitrogen in the amide and ensure it's connected to the phytosphingosine backbone.
- The phytosphingosine part should have three hydroxyl groups and a long carbon chain.
- The fatty acyl group should be a long chain attached via the amide.

Let me structure the code accordingly. I'll start by parsing the SMILES, then check for the amide group. Then verify the phytosphingosine structure with three OH groups and a long chain. Also, check the fatty acyl chain length.

I'll need to use SMARTS patterns to find specific substructures. For the amide, the pattern would be [NX3][CX3](=[OX1]). For the phytosphingosine backbone, maybe a chain with three hydroxyls and an amino group connected appropriately. Also, checking the chain lengths via number of carbons or molecular weight.

Wait, phytosphingosine's structure is (2S,3S,4R)-2-aminooctadecane
