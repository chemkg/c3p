Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was low, so there were both false positives and false negatives. Let's look at the outcomes.

First, the false positives. The code was flagging molecules that have a cyclopentenone core, esters, and unsaturated chains but aren't clavulones. The problem might be that the SMARTS patterns are too generic. For example, the cyclopentenone pattern 'C1C(=O)C=CC1' could match other structures that aren't the core of clavulones. Also, the unsaturated chain check was looking for any 4-carbon chain with a double bond, which might not be specific enough. Clavulones probably have longer or more specific chains.

The false negatives include cases where the molecular weight check excluded valid clavulones. For example, Clavirin II was missed because its weight was under 300. Maybe the molecular weight cutoff is too strict. Also, some molecules with epoxy groups (like 10,11-Epoxy-chlorovulone I) were missed because the cyclopentenone pattern didn't account for possible substitutions or ring modifications. The core detection might be too rigid.

So, to improve:

1. **Cyclopentenone Core Check**: The current SMARTS pattern might not account for substituents on the cyclopentenone ring. Clavulones might have substituents like halogens or oxygen groups attached. Need a more flexible pattern that allows substituents but maintains the core structure.

2. **Ester Groups**: The existing check just looks for any ester, but clavulones might have multiple esters. Maybe require at least two ester groups to reduce false positives.

3. **Unsaturated Chains**: The previous check for 4 carbons with a double bond is too vague. Clavulones have longer chains (like in the examples, chains with more than 4 carbons). Need a pattern that checks for longer chains with conjugated double bonds, maybe using a more specific SMARTS.

4. **Molecular Weight Cutoff**: Lower the cutoff to include smaller clavulones. Some examples might be around 300, so setting it too high excludes them.

5. **Additional Features**: Check for specific substituents like acetoxy groups (OC(=O)C) which are common in the examples. Also, ensure the cyclopentenone is part of a larger structure, not isolated.

Let's adjust the code:

- Use a more permissive cyclopentenone pattern that allows substituents.
- Require at least two ester groups.
- Check for longer unsaturated chains (maybe 5+ carbons with conjugated double bonds).
- Lower the molecular weight threshold to 250.
- Add a check for at least one acetoxy group (common in examples) to reduce false positives.

Testing these changes should capture the clavulones better and exclude others.
