Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. Looking at the false positives and negatives, here's what I notice:

**False Positives:**
- The code flagged molecules with long chains, multiple esters, or phosphate groups as polymers even if they weren't. For example, CDP-alpha-D-glucose has a phosphate but isn't a polymer. The previous checks were too broad.

**False Negatives:**
- Examples like 2-octaprenylphenol were missed. These have long isoprenoid chains but weren't detected because the isoprene check wasn't sensitive enough. The SMARTS pattern for isoprene might not capture all variations, like trans/cis configurations or longer repeats.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Mixture Check:** The initial approach checked for multiple fragments, but some polymers are single molecules with repeating units (like polyesters), not mixtures. The original definition mentions polymers as mixtures of macromolecules, but in practice, SMILES for polymers might not always be represented as mixtures. However, the examples provided (like Calcium pantothenate) are mixtures, so detecting fragments is still relevant but might not cover all cases.

2. **Repeating Units Detection:** The isoprene pattern was too strict. Real polymers might have longer or varied repeating units that the SMARTS didn't catch. Also, checking for at least 3 isoprene units might not be sufficient for some cases.

3. **Phosphate Groups:** The presence of phosphate groups led to false positives (e.g., CDP-glucose). Need to differentiate between single phosphate groups (like in nucleotides) vs. polymer backbones (like in DNA).

4. **Long Chains:** The long chain SMARTS (10 carbons) was too generic. Many non-polymer lipids have long chains but aren't polymers.

**Improvements:**
- **Adjust Mixture Check:** Keep checking for multiple fragments since many examples are salts or mixtures. But note that some polymers might be represented as single molecules with repeating units.
- **Improve Repeating Unit Detection:** Use a more flexible SMARTS for isoprene-like units (like head-to-tail repeats) and increase the required count. Also, check for multiple repeating subunits (like in polyesters).
- **Refine Phosphate Check:** Look for multiple phosphate groups in a chain rather than a single occurrence.
- **Enhance Long Chain Detection:** Instead of a fixed chain length, look for repeated motifs (like methyl branches in isoprenoids) that indicate polymer-like structures.
- **Combine Molecular Weight with Other Features:** Require high MW along with other polymer characteristics to reduce false positives.

**Revised Approach:**
1. **Check for Mixtures:** If the SMILES has multiple disconnected components, consider it a polymer (as per the examples).
2. **High Molecular Weight with Repeating Units:** For single molecules, require high MW plus repeating subunits (like multiple isoprene units, esters, or glycosidic bonds).
3. **Phosphate Backbones:** Detect multiple phosphate groups in a chain (like in nucleic acids) instead of a single phosphate.
4. **Isoprenoid Chains:** Use a better SMARTS pattern to detect consecutive isoprene-like units, possibly with more repeats.

Let's implement these changes to reduce false positives and negatives.
