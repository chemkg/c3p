</think>

Okay, I need to create a function called is_diradylglycerol that checks if a SMILES string represents a diradylglycerol. From the definition, a diradylglycerol is a glycerol molecule with two substituent groups. These substituents can be acyl (like ester groups), alkyl (ether groups), or alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether groups). The third position can be unsubstituted or have a hydroxyl group.

First, I'll start by parsing the SMILES string into an RDKit molecule. If that fails, return False and an error message.

Next, I need to verify the glycerol backbone. Glycerol has three carbons connected in a row, each with hydroxyl groups in the case of the parent compound. But in diradylglycerol, two of the positions are substituted. So maybe look for a central carbon connected to two other carbons, each of which has substituents.

Then, I need to check for exactly two substituent groups. Each substituent can be an acyl (ester), alkyl (ether), or alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether). So I'll create SMARTS patterns for each of these groups.

For acyl groups (ester), the pattern is [OX2][CX3](=[OX1]). For alkyl (ether), it's [OX2][CX4]. For alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether), maybe something like [OX2]C=CC. Wait, vinyl ether is O-C-CH2-CH2..., but the specific pattern might be [OX2]/C=C/... but I need to capture the vinyl ether group. Maybe a SMARTS like [OX2]C=C would work, but I need to make sure it's a vinyl ether. Alternatively, perhaps [OX2][CH2][CH2] but that might not be specific enough. Maybe better to use a pattern that matches the oxygen connected to a carbon that's part of a double bond. For example, [OX2]-C=C would match the vinyl ether structure.

Wait, vinyl ether is O-CR2-CH2-CH2..., but the key is the oxygen attached to a carbon that's adjacent to a double bond. Maybe the SMARTS pattern for alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether) could be [OX2]C=* where the oxygen is connected to a carbon that's part of a double bond. For example, [OX2]C=C would match the oxygen attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond. But maybe more accurately, it's [OX2]C=CR, where R is any substituent. So perhaps [OX2]C=C* as a SMARTS pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl ether group can be represented as [OX2][CH2]C=C, but I'm not sure. This part might be tricky. Maybe it's better to look for any ether (O-C) where the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond. So maybe [OX2][C^2]=C. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a more general approach is needed.

Alternatively, since the exact structure of the substituents can vary, perhaps the key is to count the number of substituent groups attached to the glycerol backbone, regardless of their type. But the substituent must be one of the three types: acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl.

So, the steps could be:

1. Check for glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row, with appropriate connectivity).
2. Check that exactly two of the three possible positions have substituents (acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl).
3. The third position may have a hydroxyl group or be unsubstituted (like in the examples, some have O or just CH2OH).

Wait, looking at the examples, some SMILES have substituents on two oxygens. For instance, the first example: O(C(=O)...)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)... So the glycerol is O-C-C-O-C(=O)... So the central carbon (chirality) has two substituents: one ester and another ester? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is glycerol with two ester groups and one hydroxyl. So in diradylglycerol, two substituents (could be any of the three types) and one hydroxyl or another substituent? Wait, the definition says "two substituent groups", so the third position is not substituted. Wait, the definition says "glycerol bearing two substituent groups". So the third position should be unsubstituted. Wait, but in some examples, like the first one: SMILES: O(C(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCC)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)CCC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCCCC. This seems to have two ester groups (O-C(=O)) and a hydroxyl (O). Wait, but that's three oxygen substituents. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me parse the SMILES:

The SMILES is O(C(=O)...)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)... So the central carbon (C[C@@H](O)) is attached to two oxygen groups: one is O(C(=O)...) (ester), another is O (hydroxyl), and the third is COC(=O)... (another ester). Wait, that's three substituents. But according to the definition, diradylglycerol should have two substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Wait, perhaps some examples have three substituents but the third is a hydroxyl, which is not counted as a substituent. Wait, the definition says "bearing two substituent groups - either acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl". So the hydroxyl is not considered a substituent. So the glycerol has three positions: two have substituents (acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl), and the third has a hydroxyl or another group (like another substituent? But according to the definition, only two substituents. So perhaps the third position must be a hydroxyl or a hydrogen (unsubstituted). Wait, but in some examples, like the first one, there are two ester groups and a hydroxyl. So two substituents (the esters) and one hydroxyl. That fits the definition. So the third position is hydroxyl, which is allowed.

So the plan is:

1. Identify the glycerol backbone. The glycerol backbone is a three-carbon chain where each carbon is connected to an oxygen. But in diradylglycerol, two of the positions have substituents (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl), and the third has a hydroxyl or is unsubstituted.

But how to identify the glycerol backbone? Maybe using a SMARTS pattern that matches the three carbons connected in a row, each attached to at least one oxygen. But in diradylglycerol, two of the oxygens are part of the substituents, and one is a hydroxyl.

Alternatively, the glycerol backbone can be represented as [CH2]-[CH]-[CH2], where each CH may have oxygen substituents. But perhaps a better approach is to look for the central carbon (the middle one in glycerol) connected to two other carbons and one oxygen. But this might vary based on the substituents.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern for the glycerol backbone, allowing for substituents. For example, the backbone could be C-C-C with each carbon connected to an oxygen. But in diradylglycerol, two of the oxygens are part of substituents (like ester groups), and one is a hydroxyl.

Wait, perhaps the glycerol backbone is better represented as:

O[C@H](COC(...))COC(...)

But that's specific to the stereochemistry. Maybe the SMARTS pattern should be more general. Let's think: the glycerol backbone is three carbons in a row, with the central carbon (possibly chiral) connected to two other carbons (the first and third carbons), each of which is connected to an oxygen. Then, the substituents are attached via those oxygens.

So the SMARTS pattern could be:

[CH2]-[CH](-[CH2])-O

But perhaps more accurately, the glycerol backbone would be something like:

[CH2](O)-[CH](O)-[CH2](O)

But in diradylglycerol, two of those oxygens are part of substituent groups (like esters, ethers, etc.), and the third is a hydroxyl. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find the three carbons of glycerol and check that two of them have substituents (via oxygen) that match the allowed types.

So steps:

1. Check that the molecule has a glycerol backbone. How? Maybe look for a central carbon connected to two other carbons, each of which is connected to an oxygen. For example, the central carbon (C2) is connected to C1 and C3. C1 and C3 are each connected to an oxygen. Then, C2 is also connected to an oxygen (hydroxyl or substituent).

But perhaps a SMARTS pattern like:

[CH2]-[CH](-[CH2])-O

Wait, not sure. Maybe better to use a SMARTS that matches the three carbons in a row, each connected to at least one oxygen. For example:

[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]

But in the example of triglyceride, that's what they used. Wait, in the example provided for triglyceride, the glycerol backbone was identified using [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4], which matches three carbons in a row with four bonds each. Then, they checked for three ester groups.

But for diradylglycerol, we need two substituents. So maybe first check for the glycerol backbone with that SMARTS, then check for two substituents (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl) attached via oxygen.

So the steps could be:

- Check for the presence of the glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row, each with four bonds).
- Check that exactly two of the three possible positions (the two terminal carbons and the central one?) have substituent groups attached via oxygen.

Wait, in glycerol, the three carbons are each connected to an -OH group. In diradylglycerol, two of those -OH groups are replaced by substituents (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl), and the third remains as -OH or is another substituent. Wait, but the definition says "two substituent groups". So regardless of the position, exactly two substituents must be present.

So the approach would be:

1. Find the glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row).
2. For each of the three carbons, check if they have an oxygen substituent that is part of a substituent group (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).
3. Ensure that exactly two such substituents are present.
4. The third oxygen substituent (if any) must be a hydroxyl group or absent (if the substituent is an alkyl or alk-1-enyl, maybe?).

But how to differentiate between substituent oxygens and hydroxyls?

Alternatively, count the number of substituent groups (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl) attached to the glycerol backbone. There must be exactly two.

So, the plan is:

- Identify the glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row).
- For each oxygen attached to these carbons, check if it's part of a substituent group (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).
- Count the number of such substituents. Must be exactly two.

So, first, find the glycerol backbone. Then, for each oxygen attached to the backbone carbons, determine if it's part of a substituent.

How to find the substituent groups:

- Acyl (ester): O-C(=O)-R
- Alkyl (ether): O-C-R (where R is an alkyl chain)
- Alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether): O-C=CH-R (or similar)

So, for each oxygen attached to the glycerol carbons, check if it's part of any of these groups.

So, create SMARTS patterns for each substituent type:

1. Acyl (ester): [OX2][CX3](=[OX1])
   This matches an oxygen connected to a carbonyl group.

2. Alkyl (ether): [OX2][CX4]
   This matches an oxygen connected to a carbon with four single bonds (like in an ether).

3. Alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether): [OX2]C=C
   This matches an oxygen connected to a carbon that is part of a double bond.

But wait, vinyl ether is O-CR2-CH2-CH2... but the structure is O-C=CH-R. So the oxygen is attached to a carbon that is part of a double bond. So the SMARTS pattern would be [OX2]C=C. But this could also match other structures, like enol ethers. But given the examples, perhaps this is sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps a more specific pattern is needed. For example, [OX2]C=CR where R is any chain. But SMARTS doesn't allow for variable-length chains easily. So maybe [OX2]C=C* would work, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, check for oxygen connected to a carbon that is part of a double bond. So the pattern [OX2]C=C would match any oxygen attached to a carbon that is part of a double bond.

But this might not be specific enough. For example, it could match a conjugated ester, but in practice, the examples of alk-1-enyl groups would have the oxygen attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl ether can be represented as [OX2][CH2]C=C. But again, this depends on the exact structure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps using the three SMARTS patterns for each substituent type and counting matches would be a start.

So, the code steps:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. Check for the glycerol backbone using a SMARTS pattern.
3. For each oxygen atom attached to the glycerol carbons, check if it's part of an acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl group.
4. Count the number of such substituents. If exactly two, return True; else, False.

But how to find the oxygen atoms attached to the glycerol carbons?

First, find the glycerol backbone atoms. Then, for each of those carbons, find the attached oxygen.

For example:

- Use the SMARTS pattern for glycerol backbone: [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]
- Find the matches in the molecule. Each match is three carbons (C1, C2, C3).
- For each of these three carbons, check if they have an oxygen attached.
- For each oxygen, check if it's part of a substituent group (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).

But this could be complex. Let's outline the code.

First, find the glycerol backbone:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]")
matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(glycerol_pattern)

But this might not capture all possible glycerol backbones, especially if there are substituents. For example, if the central carbon has two substituents, the pattern may not match. Wait, the SMARTS [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4] requires each carbon to have four bonds. But if the central carbon is connected to two oxygens (as substituents), then its valence might be different. Hmm, maybe this approach is not sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the glycerol backbone is more accurately represented as a three-carbon chain where each carbon is connected to at least one oxygen. But how to represent that in SMARTS?

Maybe:

[CH2]-[CH](-[CH2])-O

But not sure. Alternatively, look for a central carbon connected to two other carbons and one oxygen. Then, the other two carbons each have an oxygen. But this is getting too specific.

Alternatively, instead of relying on a SMARTS pattern for the entire glycerol backbone, find all possible three-carbon chains and check if they have the appropriate oxygen attachments. But this could be computationally intensive.

Alternatively, use the same approach as the triglyceride example, but adjust for two substituents.

In the triglyceride example, they checked for the glycerol backbone and then three ester groups. For diradylglycerol, we need two substituents (any of the three types) and one hydroxyl or no substituent.

So perhaps:

1. Check for the glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row).
2. For each of the three carbons, check if there's an oxygen substituent that is part of a substituent group (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).
3. Count those substituents. Must be exactly two.
4. The third position should have a hydroxyl group or no substituent (but how to check that?).

But maybe the presence of exactly two substituent groups is sufficient, regardless of the third position. Because the definition says "two substituent groups", and the third can be anything else (like hydroxyl or hydrogen).

So the code steps:

- Find the glycerol backbone.
- For each oxygen attached to the backbone carbons, check if it's part of a substituent group (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).
- If exactly two such substituents, return True.

But how to find the substituents:

For each oxygen attached to the glycerol carbons:

Check if it's part of an ester (acyl), ether (alkyl), or vinyl ether (alk-1-enyl).

So create SMARTS patterns for each:

acyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[OX2][CX3]=[OX1]")  # O-C(=O)
alkyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[OX2][CX4]")        # O-C (ether)
alkenyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[OX2]C=C")        # O-C=C (vinyl ether)

Then, for each oxygen in the molecule, check if it matches any of these patterns and is attached to a glycerol carbon.

But how to link the oxygen to the glycerol backbone.

Alternatively, for each oxygen in the molecule, check if it's bonded to a carbon that is part of the glycerol backbone. Then, check if that oxygen is part of any of the substituent patterns.

So:

1. Find all atoms in the glycerol backbone (C1, C2, C3).
2. For each of these carbons, get their neighboring atoms.
3. For each neighbor, if it's an oxygen, check if that oxygen is part of a substituent group.

So code steps:

mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
if mol is None:
    return False, "Invalid SMILES"

glycerol_backbone = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]")
if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(glycerol_backbone):
    return False, "No glycerol backbone found"

# Get the three carbons of the glycerol backbone
matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(glycerol_backbone)
# Assuming the first match is the correct one (may need to check all matches)
c1, c2, c3 = matches[0]

# Collect all oxygens attached to the glycerol carbons
substituent_count = 0
for carbon in [c1, c2, c3]:
    atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(carbon)
    for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # Oxygen
            # Check if this oxygen is part of a substituent group
            # Create a submolecule starting from the oxygen and check the patterns
            # Alternatively, check the oxygen's bonds
            # Check if the oxygen is part of an ester, ether, or vinyl ether group
            # For ester: O-C(=O)
            # For ether: O-C (single bond)
            # For vinyl ether: O-C=C
            # Let's check each case

            # Check for ester (acyl)
            ester = False
            alkyl = False
            alkenyl = False

            # Check if the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl group
            for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
                if bond.GetBeginAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx() or bond.GetEndAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx():
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # Carbon
                        for bond2 in other_atom.GetBonds():
                            if bond2.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE and bond2.GetOtherAtom(other_atom).GetAtomicNum() == 8:
                                ester = True
                                break

            # Check for ether (alkyl) - oxygen connected to a carbon with single bonds
            # If the oxygen is connected to a carbon that has only single bonds (not part of ester)
            # This is a simplification
            if not ester:
                for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
                    if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE and bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor).GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                        alkyl = True

            # Check for vinyl ether (alkenyl) - oxygen connected to a carbon with a double bond
            for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
                if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE:
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                        for bond2 in other_atom.GetBonds():
                            if bond2.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE and bond2.GetOtherAtom(other_atom).GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                                alkenyl = True
                                break

            if ester or alkyl or alkenyl:
                substituent_count += 1

if substituent_count == 2:
    return True, "Exactly two substituent groups (acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl) found on glycerol backbone"
else:
    return False, f"Found {substituent_count} substituent groups, need exactly 2"

But this approach might have flaws. For example, the way of checking for ester, alkyl, or alkenyl groups might not be accurate. Using SMARTS patterns would be more reliable.

Alternatively, use SMARTS patterns to find the substituents attached to the glycerol oxygens.

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, check if it's part of any of the three substituent types.

So:

For each oxygen attached to glycerol carbons:

- Check if it's part of an ester group (O-C(=O)-R)
- Check if it's part of an ether group (O-C-R)
- Check if it's part of a vinyl ether group (O-C=C-R)

Using SMARTS:

Acyl (ester) pattern: [OX2][CX3](=[OX1])
Alkyl (ether) pattern: [OX2][CX4]
Alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether) pattern: [OX2]C=C

But the vinyl ether pattern might need to be more specific. For example, the oxygen connected to a carbon that is part of a double bond.

But let's proceed with these patterns.

So, code steps:

1. Find all oxygens attached to the glycerol backbone carbons.
2. For each such oxygen, check if it matches any of the three substituent patterns.
3. Count the number of such matches. Must be exactly two.

But how to ensure that the oxygen is part of the substituent and not a hydroxyl?

Wait, the hydroxyl would be an oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon but not part of any of the three substituent types. So if an oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon doesn't match any of the substituent patterns, it's considered a hydroxyl.

So the code would:

mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
if not mol:
    return False, "Invalid SMILES"

# Find glycerol backbone
glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]")
if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(glycerol_pattern):
    return False, "No glycerol backbone found"

# Get all matches for glycerol backbone (could be multiple, but take first)
matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(glycerol_pattern)
if not matches:
    return False, "No glycerol backbone found"
c1, c2, c3 = matches[0]  # assuming the first match is the correct one

# Collect all oxygens attached to these carbons
substituent_oxygens = 0
for carbon in [c1, c2, c3]:
    atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(carbon)
    for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # Oxygen
            # Check if this oxygen is part of a substituent
            # Create a bond from the carbon to the oxygen
            # Now check the oxygen's environment
            # Check ester (acyl)
            ester = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts("[OX2][CX3]=[OX1]"), useChirality=True)
            # Check if the oxygen is part of an ester group
            # The oxygen is part of an ester if it's connected to a carbonyl group
            # So, for the current oxygen, check if it's bonded to a carbon that is double-bonded to an oxygen
            oxygen_idx = neighbor.GetIdx()
            ester_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(f"[#{carbon}]O[CX3]=O"))
            if ester_matches:
                substituent_oxygens +=1
                continue
            # Check alkyl (ether)
            # Oxygen is connected to a carbon with four single bonds (like in ether)
            # But this is hard to capture. Alternatively, check if the oxygen is part of an ether group (O-C)
            # and the carbon is not part of an ester or other group.
            # Maybe use the SMARTS [OX2][CX4]
            ether_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(f"[#{carbon}]O[CD4]"))
            if ether_matches:
                substituent_oxygens +=1
                continue
            # Check alkenyl (vinyl ether)
            # Oxygen connected to a carbon that is part of a double bond
            alkenyl_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(f"[#{carbon}]O/C=C/"))
            if alkenyl_matches:
                substituent_oxygens +=1
                continue

But this approach may not work because the SMARTS patterns are not correctly anchored to the specific oxygen and carbon.

Alternatively, for each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, check if it's part of any of the three substituent patterns.

So:

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon:

- Check if it's part of an ester group (O-C(=O))
- Check if it's part of an ether group (O-C)
- Check if it's part of a vinyl ether group (O-C=C)

But how to do this accurately.

Perhaps the best way is to use SMARTS patterns that start from the oxygen and check the required structure.

For example:

Acyl (ester) SMARTS: [O;X2][C;X3](=O)
Alkyl (ether) SMARTS: [O;X2][C;X4]
Alk-1-enyl (vinyl ether) SMARTS: [O;X2][C;X3]=[C]

But the vinyl ether pattern might need to be more specific. For example, [O;X2][C]=[C]

But SMARTS for vinyl ether could be [O][C]=C.

So, for each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, check if it matches any of these three patterns.

In code:

acyl_smarts = "[OX2][CX3]=[OX1]"  # O-C(=O)
alkyl_smarts = "[OX2][CX4]"       # O-C (ether)
alkenyl_smarts = "[OX2]C=C"       # O-C=C (vinyl ether)

acyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(acyl_smarts)
alkyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(alkyl_smarts)
alkenyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts(alkenyl_smarts)

Then, for each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, check if it's part of any of these patterns.

But how to ensure that the oxygen is part of the pattern and connected to the glycerol carbon.

Alternatively, for each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, create a submol that includes the oxygen and its neighboring atoms, and check against the patterns.

But this might be complex.

Alternatively, use the following approach:

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon:

- Check if the oxygen is part of an ester group (O-C(=O)-R)
   This can be done by checking if the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that is double-bonded to another oxygen.

- Check if the oxygen is part of an ether group (O-C-R)
   This can be done by checking if the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that has no double bonds (maybe).

- Check if the oxygen is part of a vinyl ether group (O-C=C-R)
   Check if the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that is part of a double bond.

But implementing this in code would require checking the bonds of the neighboring atoms.

Alternatively, use the following code:

substituent_count = 0

for carbon in [c1, c2, c3]:
    atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(carbon)
    for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # Oxygen
            o_bonds = [bond for bond in neighbor.GetBonds()]
            # Check for ester (O-C(=O))
            for bond in o_bonds:
                if bond.GetBeginAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx() or bond.GetEndAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx():
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # Carbon
                        for bond2 in other_atom.GetBonds():
                            if bond2.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE and bond2.GetOtherAtom(other_atom).GetAtomicNum() == 8:
                                substituent_count +=1
                                break

            # Check for ether (O-C)
            # If the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that has only single bonds
            # This is a simplification
            # Count as ether if not part of ester or alkenyl
            # But how?
            # Alternatively, check if the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that has no double bonds
            for bond in o_bonds:
                if bond.GetBeginAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx() or bond.GetEndAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx():
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                        has_double = False
                        for bond2 in other_atom.GetBonds():
                            if bond2.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:
                                has_double = True
                                break
                        if not has_double:
                            substituent_count +=1
                            break

            # Check for alkenyl (O-C=C)
            # Check if the oxygen is bonded to a carbon that is part of a double bond
            for bond in o_bonds:
                if bond.GetBeginAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx() or bond.GetEndAtomIdx() == neighbor.GetIdx():
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                        for bond2 in other_atom.GetBonds():
                            if bond2.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE and bond2.GetOtherAtom(other_atom).GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                                substituent_count +=1
                                break

But this code could overcount because a single oxygen could be part of multiple checks. For example, an oxygen in an ester group might also be counted as part of an ether if there's a mistake in the checks.

This approach is error-prone. Using SMARTS patterns would be more reliable.

Another approach: for each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon, check if it matches any of the three substituent patterns.

But how to ensure that the oxygen is part of the substituent attached to the glycerol.

Perhaps:

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon:

1. Check if the oxygen is part of an ester group (O-C(=O)-R). The SMARTS pattern would be [O;X2][C;X3](=[O;X1]) which matches the ester group.

2. Check if the oxygen is part of an ether group (O-C-R). The SMARTS pattern would be [O;X2][C;X4].

3. Check if the oxygen is part of a vinyl ether group (O-C=C-R). The SMARTS pattern would be [O;X2][C;X3]=[C].

But the SMARTS for vinyl ether might need to be more specific.

In code:

    if substituent_count == 2:
        return True, "Exactly two substituent groups (acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl) found"
    else:
        return False, f"Found {substituent_count} substituent groups, need exactly 2"

Wait, but this code checks each oxygen in the entire molecule against the patterns, not just the ones attached to the glycerol carbons. That's incorrect. The code needs to check only the oxygens attached to the glycerol carbons.

So, the correct approach is to iterate over each oxygen attached to the glycerol carbons and check if that oxygen is part of any of the substituent patterns.

But how to check if a specific oxygen atom matches a pattern.

To do this, we can use the following method:

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon:

1. Get the oxygen's atom index.
2. Check if there's a match in the molecule for the substituent pattern that includes this oxygen.

For example, for the acyl pattern, the oxygen must be part of an ester group. So, we can check if the oxygen is part of any match of the acyl pattern.

But how to check if the specific oxygen is part of a match.

So:

For each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon:

    o_idx = neighbor.GetIdx()

    # Check acyl (ester)
    for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(acyl_pattern):
        if o_idx in match:
            substituent_count +=1
            break
    else:
        # Check alkyl (ether)
        for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(alkyl_pattern):
            if o_idx in match:
                substituent_count +=1
                break
        else:
            # Check alkenyl (vinyl ether)
            for match in mol.GetSubstructMatches(alkenyl_pattern):
                if o_idx in match:
                    substituent_count +=1
                    break

This way, each oxygen is checked against all matches of the substituent patterns, and if it's part of any of them, it's counted as a substituent.

This approach should work, but it could be computationally intensive for large molecules. However, given the typical size of lipids, it's manageable.

    if substituent_count == 2:
        return True, "Two substituent groups (acyl, alkyl, or alk-1-enyl) found on glycerol"
    else:
        return False, f"Found {substituent_count} substituent groups, need exactly 2"

But there's a problem here: each oxygen attached to a glycerol carbon could be part of multiple matches. For example, an oxygen in an ester group would match the acyl pattern and possibly others. However, since we break after finding a match, each oxygen is counted only once.

Another issue is that the SMARTS patterns may not be specific enough. For example, the alkyl pattern [OX2][CX4] would match any oxygen attached to a carbon with four bonds, which could include hydroxyl groups if the carbon is part of a larger structure. Wait, no: hydroxyl oxygen is O-H, so the oxygen in a hydroxyl group would have only one bond (to the carbon), but in that case, the oxygen's bond count would be 1, but in the SMARTS pattern [OX2], which requires two bonds. So hydroxyl oxygens (with one bond) would not match the substituent patterns. That's good.

Wait, in an ester group, the oxygen is bonded to the carbonyl carbon (two bonds: one to the glycerol carbon, one to the carbonyl carbon). So in the ester pattern, the oxygen has two bonds (correct). In an ether (O-C-R), the oxygen has two bonds (one to the glycerol carbon, one to the R group). So [OX2] is correct. Hydroxyl groups have one bond (O-H), so they would have X1, not X2. Therefore, the substituent patterns correctly exclude hydroxyl groups.

So this code should count only the substituent oxygens (ester, ether, vinyl ether) attached to the glycerol carbons. If exactly two are found, it's a diradylglycerol.

Testing this code with the example SMILES strings:

Take the first example: O(C(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCC)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)CCC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCCCC

The glycerol backbone is the central C[C@@H](O)CO... part. The oxygens attached to the glycerol carbons are:

- The O in O(C(=O)...) (ester)
- The O in COC(=O)... (ester)
- The O in C[C@@H](O) (hydroxyl)

So two substituents (esters), which should count as two. The hydroxyl is not counted. So the function returns True.

Another example: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol: SMILES CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC[C@H](CO)OC(=O)CCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCCCC

The glycerol has two ester groups (O-C(=O)), so substituent_count is 2. Returns True.

An example with one substituent: DG(0:0/0:0/0:0): SMILES O[C@H](CO)CO. Here, no substituents (only hydroxyls), so returns False.

Another example with three substituents: a triglyceride would have three esters. The function would count three, returns False.

Thus, this code should work.

But there's a potential issue: the code assumes that the first match of the glycerol pattern is the correct one. If there are multiple three-carbon chains in the molecule, this could lead to incorrect matches. To handle this, the code should check all possible glycerol backbone matches and ensure that at least one of them has exactly two substituents. However, for simplicity, the code checks only the first match, which may be sufficient for typical cases.

Another potential issue is the SMARTS pattern for the glycerol backbone. The pattern [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4] looks for three carbons in a row, each with four bonds. But in diradylglycerol, the central carbon may have three bonds (if it's chiral). For example, in the SMILES O(C(=O)...)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)..., the central carbon (C[C@@H](O)) has three bonds: to the previous carbon, to the oxygen, and to the next carbon. So its valence is three, not four. Therefore, the SMARTS pattern [CHX4] would not match. This is a problem.

Ah, this is a critical issue. The current glycerol_pattern uses [CHX4], which requires the central carbon to have four bonds. But in the example SMILES strings, the central carbon may have three bonds (due to chirality or substituents). So the SMARTS pattern is incorrect.

For example, in the SMILES O(C(=O)...)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)..., the central carbon (C in C[C@@H](O)) has bonds to:

- The previous carbon (C)
- The next carbon (COC...)
- The oxygen (O)

That's three bonds. So the central carbon has three bonds, not four. Hence, the SMARTS pattern [CHX4] (which matches a carbon with four bonds and one hydrogen) would not match.

This means the current approach to detecting the glycerol backbone is flawed.

So, how to correctly identify the glycerol backbone?

Glycerol is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2OH. In diradylglycerol, two of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by substituents. The backbone is three carbons in a row, each connected to an oxygen. But the exact bonding may vary.

Perhaps a better SMARTS pattern for the glycerol backbone is:

[CH2]-[CH](-[CH2])-O

But this is too vague. Alternatively, look for a three-carbon chain where each carbon is connected to at least one oxygen.

But how to represent that in SMARTS.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches three carbons in a row, where the first and third carbons are connected to an oxygen, and the central carbon is connected to an oxygen. But this might not be flexible enough.

Another approach: the glycerol backbone is three carbons where each has at least one oxygen attached. But in diradylglycerol, two of those oxygens are part of substituents.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the original SMARTS pattern is incorrect and needs to be adjusted.

Alternative SMARTS pattern for glycerol backbone: [C]([O])[C]([O])[C]([O])

But this would match any three carbons each with an oxygen, which is not specific.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches the connectivity of glycerol, regardless of the substituents:

[CX4H2][CX4H]([OX2])[CX4H2]

But this would match a central carbon with one oxygen and two CH2 groups.

Alternatively, use:

[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]

But as discussed, this requires four bonds on each carbon, which may not be the case.

This is a significant problem. For example, in the SMILES string O(C(=O)...)C[C@@H](O)COC(=O)..., the central carbon (C in C[C@@H](O)) has three bonds (two to carbons and one to oxygen), so its valence is three. Thus, the SMARTS pattern [CHX4] (which requires four bonds) would not match.

So the initial approach to detect the glycerol backbone is incorrect.

To resolve this, perhaps the glycerol backbone can be represented as any three-carbon chain where each carbon is connected to at least one oxygen. But how to write that in SMARTS.

Alternatively, use a more flexible SMARTS pattern that matches three carbons in a row, each with at least one oxygen attached.

The SMARTS pattern would be:

[C;H2,O][C;H1,O][C;H2,O]

But this is not precise. Alternatively:

[C]([O])[C]([O])[C]([O])

But this requires each carbon to have an oxygen, which is not the case in diradylglycerol (two substituents and one hydroxyl).

Alternatively, look for three carbons in a row, with at least two oxygens attached in total.

But this is too vague.

Alternatively, forget the SMARTS pattern for glycerol and instead look for any three-carbon chain where two of the carbons have oxygen substituents that are part of the allowed groups.

But this approach is also complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to adjust the SMARTS pattern for the glycerol backbone to allow for three bonds on the central carbon.

The original triglyceride example used [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4], but that requires four bonds on each carbon. In diradylglycerol, the central carbon may have three bonds. So perhaps adjust the SMARTS pattern to allow for three bonds.

For example:

The glycerol backbone could be represented as:

[CH2X4][CHX3][CH2X4]

But [CHX3] would match a carbon with three bonds. However, this may not capture all cases.

Alternatively, use a more general pattern that doesn't enforce the exact number of bonds:

[CH2]-[CH]-[CH2]

But this would match any three-carbon chain, which is too broad.

This is a challenging problem. Given the examples provided, perhaps the correct approach is to use a SMARTS pattern that matches the three carbons in a row, regardless of their bonding, and then check for the presence of two substituent groups.

But this could lead to false positives.

Alternatively, consider that the glycerol backbone is a three-carbon chain with the structure HOCH2-CHOH-CH2OH, but with two of the hydroxyl groups replaced by substituents. So the remaining hydroxyl may or may not be present.

But how to represent that in SMARTS.

Perhaps the best approach is to use a SMARTS pattern that matches the three carbons in a row, each connected to at least one oxygen, and then check the substituents.

But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that uses the original SMARTS pattern but acknowledges that it may not catch all cases. However, based on the examples, the central carbon in the glycerol backbone may have three bonds, so the SMARTS pattern needs to be adjusted.

Let me adjust the glycerol_pattern to allow the central carbon to have three bonds:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX3][CH2X4]")

But I'm not sure if this works. Alternatively, use:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2][CH][CH2]")

This would match any three carbons in a row, regardless of bonds. Then, check that each carbon has at least one oxygen attached.

But this approach would require additional checks.

So, code steps:

1. Find all three-carbon chains in the molecule.
2. For each three-carbon chain, check if each carbon has at least one oxygen attached.
3. For those that do, check if there are exactly two substituent groups.

But this is computationally intensive.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches three carbons in a row, each with at least one oxygen attached:

pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[C]([O])[C]([O])[C]([O])")

But this would require each carbon to have an oxygen, which is not the case for diradylglycerol (only two substituents and one hydroxyl). So this pattern would not match.

This is a challenging problem. Given the time, perhaps proceed with the initial code but adjust the glycerol_pattern to allow the central carbon to have three bonds.

In the example SMILES strings, the central carbon often has three bonds (e.g., C[C@@H](O)...), so the SMARTS pattern [CHX3] may be needed.

So, adjusting the glycerol_pattern to:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX3][CH2X4]")

This would match a three-carbon chain where the first and third carbons have four bonds (like CH2 groups), and the central carbon
