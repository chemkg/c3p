Wait, but the SMARTS pattern [c](-O):[c](-O) might not account for all possible adjacent positions. For example, in a benzene ring with hydroxyls on positions 1 and 2, the pattern would match. But in a different aromatic system, like a fused ring where two adjacent carbons are part of a different ring, it should still work.

Testing this code with the example SMILES:

Take 3,4-dimethylcatechol: SMILES is OC1=C(O)C=CC(=C1C)C. The hydroxyls are on positions 1 and 2 (adjacent) of the benzene ring. The SMARTS pattern should match.

Another example: 3-chloro-4-methylcatechol: SMILES is C=1(C(=C(C=CC1O)C)Cl)O. The hydroxyls are on positions 1 and 2 (assuming numbering starts where the Cl is). Wait, perhaps the SMILES is written as Oc1c(Cl)c(C)cc(O)c1. The exact SMILES might vary, but the code should find the adjacent OH groups.

Another test case: 2-S-cysteinyl-DOPA: SMILES is N[C@@H](CSc1c(C[C@H](N)C(O)=O)ccc(O)c1O)C(O)=O. The catechol group is on the benzene ring with OHs in adjacent positions.

So the code using the SMARTS pattern should correctly identify these cases.

Therefore, the revised code should work better than the previous approach. The previous code might have failed because it checked for benzene rings specifically and then looked for adjacent oxygens, which might not have been correctly implemented. The SMARTS approach is more direct and reliable.

Now, implement this code.

To classify catechols, we need to identify molecules containing an o-diphenol structure - two adjacent hydroxyl groups on an aromatic ring. The key improvement from the previous attempt is using a targeted SMARTS pattern to directly match this structural feature.
