"""
which is a glycerol backbone with two hydroxyl groups and one ester. The original code's SMARTS for monoacylglycerol was "[CH2X4][CHX4]([OH])[CH2X4]", which might not match if the central carbon has the ester instead of a hydroxyl. Maybe the pattern needs to account for either hydroxyl or ester groups attached to the glycerol.

Another issue could be the handling of stereochemistry in fatty acid chains. The original code used a SMARTS pattern for unsaturated bonds, but maybe it's missing some cases. Also, the chain length check: using a SMARTS pattern to find at least 12 carbons might not be reliable. Instead, maybe counting the carbons in the chain after the ester or amide group would be better.

So, to improve:
1. Simplify the ethanolamide check by ensuring the presence of the ethanolamine group (amide linked to ethanolamine: NCCO).
2. For monoacylglycerol, check for a glycerol backbone (three carbons with two hydroxyls and one ester) using a more flexible SMARTS pattern.
3. Check for long chains (maybe at least 12 carbons) in the fatty acid parts.
4. Ensure the code handles different substitution positions on the glycerol.
5. Avoid recursive or stack-based chain traversal that could cause timeouts. Instead, use SMARTS patterns to find the chains.

Let me adjust the code accordingly. For the ethanolamide part, use a SMARTS like "[NH]CCO" connected to a longer chain. For the glycerol part, look for a central carbon connected to two hydroxyls and one ester. For the fatty acid, check for a chain of at least 12 carbons. Also, handle ethers and other linkages mentioned in the examples.

Another thing: the original code returned (None, None) for invalid SMILES, but the problem says to return a boolean and a reason. So, in case of invalid SMILES, return False with "Invalid SMILES".

Testing with the example SMILES for palmitoyl ethanolamide: the code should find the ethanolamide group (NCCO) and a long chain (16 carbons). The previous code's chain check might not have detected this properly.

Let's rewrite the code using more efficient SMARTS patterns and avoid the stack-based traversal. Maybe using SMARTS to find the ethanolamide group and the glycerol structure, then check chain lengths via SMARTS or atom counts.

So, here's the revised approach:

1. Check for ethanolamide group: amide (NC(=O)) connected to ethanolamine (NCCO).
   SMARTS: [NH](CCO)C(=O)[*]
2. Check for monoacylglycerol: glycerol backbone (three carbons) with two hydroxyls and one ester.
   SMARTS: [CH2]-[CH](-O-[C](=O)-[*])-[CH2] where the central CH has two O groups (maybe one ester and one hydroxyl).
   Alternatively, look for a glycerol with exactly two hydroxyl groups and one ester.
3. For the fatty acid chains, check the length by counting carbons in the chain attached to the ester or amide.

Implementing these with SMARTS and atom counts should be more efficient and avoid timeouts.

Another example: 2-arachidonoylglycerol has a glycerol with two hydroxyls and one ester. The chain after the ester is arachidonic acid (20 carbons with multiple double bonds). The code should detect the glycerol structure and the long chain.

Also, endocannabinoids include structures with ethanolamide or glycerol ester groups attached to long-chain fatty acids. So, the code should check for either of these two main structural features.

Putting this together:

- Check if the molecule has either an ethanolamide group attached to a long chain or a monoacylglycerol structure with a long chain.

- For ethanolamide:
   - Find the NCCO group connected via an amide.
   - Check that the chain connected to the amide is at least 16 carbons (like palmitoyl) or longer.

- For monoacylglycerol:
   - Find the glycerol backbone with two hydroxyls and one ester.
   - Check that the ester is connected to a long chain (e.g., 20 carbons for arachidonic acid).

So, in code:

Use SMARTS patterns to find these groups and then check the chain lengths.

Let's try writing this with SMARTS and then count the chain length.

For ethanolamide:

ethanolamide_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[NH](CCO)C(=O)-[*]")
If this matches, then check the chain attached to the carbonyl.

For the chain, follow the R group from the carbonyl and count the carbons.

Similarly, for the glycerol part:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2]-[CH](-O-C(=O)-[*])-[CH2]")
But need to ensure that there are two hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, look for a glycerol where two of the OH groups are present and one is an ester.

Maybe:

glycerol_ester_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2][CH]([OH])[CH2]OC(=O)[*]")

But this might not capture all cases. Alternatively, use a more general pattern.

Once the groups are found, check the attached chains for length.

To count chain length, perhaps starting from the carbonyl oxygen in the ester or amide, traverse the chain and count carbons.

But chain traversal can be tricky. Maybe using SMARTS to find a long aliphatic chain.

But how to count the length. Maybe a SMARTS like [CX4][CX4]{12,} to represent a chain of at least 12 carbons.

Alternatively, for the amide case, after finding the amide group, follow the R group (the part before the carbonyl) and count the carbons.

But this requires traversing the atoms. Let's see.

In code:

For ethanolamide matches:

for match in ethanolamide_matches:
   amide_n = match[0]
   # find the atom attached to the carbonyl (next to the amide N)
   carbonyl_c = amide_n.GetNeighbors()[0]  # assuming the N is bonded to the carbonyl C
   r_group = carbonyl_c.GetNeighbors()[0]  # the R group is the other neighbor of the carbonyl C
   # traverse the R group to count carbons
   # but this might need a recursive approach, which could be slow for long chains.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches the amide group followed by a long chain.

Like: [NH](CCO)C(=O)-[CX4]{12,}

But SMARTS doesn't support quantifiers like {12,} directly. So maybe use a pattern that repeats 12 times, which is impractical.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS like [NH](CCO)C(=O)-C(-[CX4]){12,} but again, not feasible.

So maybe the best approach is to find the amide group, then traverse the R group to count the carbons.

But to avoid stack overflow or timeouts, limit the depth.

Alternatively, after finding the amide group, check if the R group has at least 12 carbons in a row without branching.

This is complicated.

Alternatively, check the molecular weight. If the molecule is large enough, it's likely to have a long chain.

But that's not reliable.

Alternatively, use the presence of a long aliphatic chain in the molecule, which can be detected with a SMARTS like [CH2] chain.

But again, not precise.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the previous code's approach of checking for at least 12 carbons in the chain after the amide or ester is necessary, but the implementation was causing a timeout.

In the palmitoyl ethanolamide example, the chain is 16 carbons. So the code needs to count that.

But the stack-based approach might have taken too long. Maybe using a non-recursive method to count the chain.

Alternatively, use the SMILES string to count the number of 'C's in the chain after the amide.

But that's not reliable due to branches or rings.

Alternatively, use the RDKit's GetSubstructMatches to find a long chain.

But how?

Alternatively, for the amide case, once the amide group is found, the R group is the part before the carbonyl. So, for example, in 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCO', the R group is a 16-carbon chain.

If I can get the size of that chain, that would work.

So, perhaps:

For each amide match:
   get the atoms in the R group (the part attached to the carbonyl)
   traverse the R group's carbons in a linear chain, counting the length.

But how to do that without recursion.

Maybe using a loop to follow the chain until a branch or non-carbon atom is found.

Here's an approach:

def count_chain_length(atom, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    if atom.GetAtomicNum() != 6 or atom.GetIdx() in visited:
        return 0
    visited.add(atom.GetIdx())
    max_length = 0
    for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and neighbor.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE:
            length = 1 + count_chain_length(neighbor, visited)
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
    return max_length

But this is recursive and could hit stack limits for long chains. Alternatively, use an iterative approach.

Another way: start at the R group's first carbon and follow the longest possible chain of single-bonded carbons.

But this is complex.

Alternatively, for the purpose of this problem, assume that the chain is linear and count the number of carbons in a row after the carbonyl.

In the example, the chain is CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC, which is 16 carbons.

So, in code:

For the amide group, find the carbonyl carbon (C=O), then the adjacent carbon (the first carbon of the R group). Then count how many consecutive carbons are in a single chain from there.

But again, how to implement this without recursion.

Perhaps:

def get_chain_length(start_atom):
    length = 0
    current_atom = start_atom
    visited = set()
    while True:
        if current_atom.GetAtomicNum() != 6 or current_atom.GetIdx() in visited:
            break
        visited.add(current_atom.GetIdx())
        length +=1
        # find next carbon in chain
        next_atoms = [n for n in current_atom.GetNeighbors() 
                      if n.GetAtomicNum() == 6 
                      and n.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE 
                      and n.GetIdx() not in visited]
        if len(next_atoms) != 1:
            break  # branch or end
        current_atom = next_atoms[0]
    return length

This function starts at the given atom and follows the chain until it hits a non-carbon, a branch, or a visited atom. This should work for linear chains.

Then, in the code:

For each amide match:
   carbonyl_c = ...  # the C in C=O
   r_group_start = [n for n in carbonyl_c.GetNeighbors() if n.GetAtomicNum() ==6 and n != amide_n][0]
   chain_length = get_chain_length(r_group_start)
   if chain_length >= 12:
       # valid chain

Similarly for the ester in monoacylglycerol.

This approach avoids recursion and uses a loop, which should be more efficient.

So integrating this into the code.

Also, for the monoacylglycerol part:

Check for a glycerol backbone (three carbons) with two hydroxyls and one ester.

The SMARTS pattern could be something like:

[CH2]-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2]

But also need to ensure that the other two CH2 groups have hydroxyls.

Wait, the glycerol backbone in monoacylglycerol has two hydroxyl groups and one ester. So the central CH has an ester, and the two CH2 groups have hydroxyls.

So the SMARTS could be:

[CH2]([OH])-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2]([OH])

But this might be too specific. Alternatively, use a more flexible pattern.

Alternatively, look for a molecule that has a substructure matching a glycerol (three carbons) with two hydroxyl groups and one ester group.

So the SMARTS pattern could be:

[CH2]-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2] where two of the CH2 groups have hydroxyls.

But how to ensure that. Maybe:

glycerol_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2][CH]([OH])[CH2]OC(=O)[*]")

But this would match a glycerol where the central CH has a hydroxyl and one of the CH2 has the ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, look for any glycerol (three carbons) with two hydroxyl groups and one ester group, regardless of their positions.

So:

Find all occurrences of three connected carbons where two have hydroxyls and one has an ester.

This requires a more complex SMARTS.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that allows any arrangement of two hydroxyls and one ester on the three carbons.

For example:

([CH2]-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2])(-O) | ([CH2]-[CH](-O)-[CH2](-O-C(=O)-*))

But SMARTS doesn't support OR conditions. So perhaps search for the presence of two hydroxyl groups and one ester in the molecule, along with a three-carbon chain.

Alternatively, use two separate patterns: one for each possible arrangement.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, count the number of hydroxyl groups and ester groups in the molecule, and check that there are two hydroxyls and one ester. But this is not sufficient, as other parts of the molecule could have these groups.

So, perhaps the best approach is to first find the glycerol backbone (three carbons in a row), then check that two of them have hydroxyls and one has an ester.

To find three carbons in a row:

glycerol_backbone = Chem.MolFromSmarts("C-C-C")

Then, for each match, check the substituents.

But this would require iterating over all possible three-carbon chains and checking their substituents, which could be time-consuming.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches three carbons with exactly two hydroxyl groups and one ester.

For example:

"[CH2]-[CH](-O-[C](=O)-*)-[CH2](-O)"

This would match a central carbon with an ester and one of the CH2 groups with a hydroxyl. But this might miss cases where the ester is on a different carbon.

Alternatively, create three separate patterns for each possible position of the ester and hydroxyls.

This is getting complicated, but necessary for accuracy.

For example:

Pattern 1: ester on the central carbon, hydroxyls on the two CH2 groups.

[CH2](-O)-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2](-O)

Wait, no, that would have three hydroxyls. Need exactly two.

Pattern 1: central carbon has ester, one CH2 has hydroxyl, other CH2 has no substituent.

But how to express that.

Alternatively, use logical constraints in SMARTS.

But SMARTS doesn't support counting directly. So perhaps:

For the three carbons:

- Two of them have hydroxyl groups (either as -O or -OH)
- One of them has an ester group (-O-C(=O)-*)

So, the SMARTS pattern would need to match three carbons in a row where two have hydroxyls and one has an ester.

This is challenging. Perhaps the best way is to first find all three-carbon chains and then check their substituents.

In code:

glycerol_backbone = Chem.MolFromSmarts("C-C-C")
matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(glycerol_backbone)
for match in matches:
    c1, c2, c3 = match
    # check substituents of each carbon
    hydroxyl_count = 0
    ester_count = 0
    for atom in [c1, c2, c3]:
        for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
            if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # oxygen
                # check if it's a hydroxyl
                if neighbor.GetTotalNumHs() >=1 and neighbor.GetDegree() ==1:
                    hydroxyl_count +=1
                # check if it's part of an ester
                # ester is O connected to C=O
                if neighbor.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE:
                    ester_group = False
                    for nbr in neighbor.GetNeighbors():
                        if nbr.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in nbr.GetBonds()):
                            ester_count +=1
                            ester_group = True
                            break
                    if ester_group:
                        break
    if hydroxyl_count ==2 and ester_count ==1:
        # found a valid glycerol backbone with two hydroxyls and one ester
        break
else:
    # no such structure found

This approach could work but requires iterating over all three-carbon chains and checking their substituents, which might be slow for large molecules.

But given the examples, this might be necessary.

Once the glycerol backbone is found, then check the ester's R group for a long chain.

Similarly to the ethanolamide case, traverse the chain from the ester's carbonyl carbon.

Putting all this together, the code would:

1. Check for ethanolamide group with a long chain.
2. Check for monoacylglycerol structure with a long chain.
3. Return True if either is present.

Now, implementing this in code, avoiding recursion for chain traversal, and ensuring efficiency.

Let's write the code step by step.

First, parse the SMILES and check validity.

Then, check for ethanolamide:

- Find the ethanolamine group (NCCO) connected via an amide.
- For each match, check the R group's chain length.

Then, check for monoacylglycerol:

- Find three-carbon backbone with two hydroxyls and one ester.
- Check the ester's R group chain length.

If either is present with sufficient chain length, return True.

Now, code:

Implement the get_chain_length function as an iterative method.

Then, check ethanolamide:

ethanolamide_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[NH]CCO")
matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(ethanolamide_pattern)
for match in matches:
    n_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(match[0])
    # check if the N is part of an amide group (connected to a carbonyl)
    for neighbor in n_atom.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in neighbor.GetBonds()):
            # found carbonyl C
            carbonyl_c = neighbor
            # get the R group attached to the carbonyl (other than the N)
            r_group_atoms = [a for a in carbonyl_c.GetNeighbors() if a != n_atom]
            if not r_group_atoms:
                continue
            r_group_start = r_group_atoms[0]
            chain_length = get_chain_length(r_group_start)
            if chain_length >= 12:
                return True, "Ethanolamide with long chain"

Similarly for monoacylglycerol:

Check for three-carbon backbone with two hydroxyls and one ester.

Then, check the ester's R group chain length.

But how to find the ester group in the glycerol.

Alternatively, find all ester groups and check if they are part of a glycerol backbone.

Ester pattern: "[OX2][CX3](=[OX1])"

For each ester oxygen, check if it's attached to a glycerol carbon.

This is getting complex, but let's proceed.

Putting it all together:

The code should:

- Check for ethanolamide with long chain.
- Check for monoacylglycerol with long chain.
- Return True if either is found.

Testing with the example SMILES:

For palmitoyl ethanolamide (CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCO):

The ethanolamide pattern matches. The R group is 16 carbons. So chain_length is 16 >=12 → True.

For 2-arachidonoylglycerol ([H]C(CO)(CO)OC(=O)...):

The monoacylglycerol check should find the glycerol backbone with two hydroxyls (CO groups) and one ester. The ester's R group is a long chain.

So, the code should return True.

Now, implementing this in code with the get_chain_length function.

But wait, the previous code had a timeout. Maybe due to the recursive function. So replacing it with an iterative approach.

Rewriting get_chain_length as:

def get_chain_length(start_atom):
    length = 0
    current_atom = start_atom
    visited = set()
    while True:
        if current_atom.GetAtomicNum() != 6 or current_atom.GetIdx() in visited:
            break
        visited.add(current_atom.GetIdx())
        length += 1
        # Look for next carbon in chain (single bond, not part of a ring, no branching)
        next_atoms = []
        for neighbor in current_atom.GetNeighbors():
            if (neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and
                neighbor.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.SINGLE and
                neighbor.GetIdx() not in visited and
                not neighbor.IsInRing()):
                next_atoms.append(neighbor)
        if len(next_atoms) != 1:
            break  # branch or end
        current_atom = next_atoms[0]
    return length

This function iteratively follows the longest possible chain of single-bonded carbons, avoiding rings and branches.

Now, putting it all together.

Also, need to handle cases where the chain has double bonds (like arachidonic acid), which are allowed. The get_chain_length function checks for single bonds, which would exclude double bonds. That's a problem because the examples have double bonds in the chains.

Ah, right. The chain can have double bonds, so the bond type should not be restricted to single. So, modify the next_atoms condition to allow any bond type except aromatic (maybe):

for neighbor in current_atom.GetNeighbors():
    if (neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and
        not neighbor.GetIsAromatic() and
        neighbor.GetIdx() not in visited and
        not neighbor.IsInRing()):
        # Check if the bond is single or double (part of the chain)
        bond = mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(current_atom.GetIdx(), neighbor.GetIdx())
        if bond.GetBondType() in (Chem.BondType.SINGLE, Chem.BondType.DOUBLE):
            next_atoms.append(neighbor)

But this might include double bonds which are part of the chain. However, traversing double bonds could lead to issues if the chain branches. For example, a double bond has two neighbors, but in reality, it's a single path.

But in SMILES, double bonds are directional, but in the molecule, they are just bonds. So, for a chain like C=C-C, each carbon in the double bond has one neighbor.

But this complicates the traversal. Maybe the get_chain_length function should ignore bond types and just follow carbons, ensuring they form a continuous chain without branching.

So, modify the next_atoms selection to allow any bond type, but ensure that there's only one possible path.

This is tricky. For example, in a double bond (C=C), each carbon has one neighbor. So, the code would follow that.

In the case of all-trans double bonds, the chain is still linear.

So, modifying the next_atoms code:

for neighbor in current_atom.GetNeighbors():
    if (neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and
        neighbor.GetIdx() not in visited and
        not neighbor.IsInRing()):
        bond = mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(current_atom.GetIdx(), neighbor.GetIdx())
        if bond is not None:
            next_atoms.append(neighbor)

Then, if len(next_atoms) == 1, proceed.

This would allow any bond type (single, double, triple), as long as it's a carbon chain.

This should work for chains with double bonds.

Now, testing this function on a chain like CCCCC=CCCC.

The chain would be followed as C-C-C-C-C=C-C-C-C, giving a length of 8.

But when current_atom is the fifth carbon (the one in the double bond), the next neighbor is the sixth carbon. The code would proceed.

So, this should correctly count the chain length including double bonds.

Now, integrating this into the code.

Finally, after checking both ethanolamide and monoacylglycerol structures, return True if either is found with sufficient chain length.

Also, check for other endocannabinoid structures like glyceryl ethers. For example, 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether has an ether linkage instead of an ester. But according to the examples, these are also endocannabinoids. So, the current code would miss them because it's looking for esters or amides.

This indicates that the code needs to also check for ether-linked chains. However, the examples provided include both esters and amides, but also ethers. For example, "2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether" has an ether linkage.

So, the current approach would miss ether-linked endocannabinoids.

But according to the problem statement, endocannabinoids include ethanolamides and glycerol esters, but the examples also include ethers. So, the code needs to account for that.

This complicates things further. How to detect ether-linked chains.

For example, the SMILES for 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether is "CCCCOC(CO)CO". The glycerol part is OC(CO)CO, and the ether is attached to the arachidonyl chain.

So, the code needs to check for glycerol structures with ether linkages.

Thus, the code should check for:

- Ethanolamide with long chain.
- Glycerol with ester or ether and long chain.

But detecting ethers is more complex.

In this case, the code may need to check for glycerol backbones with either ester or ether groups attached to long chains.

So, modifying the monoacylglycerol check to include ethers.

But how?

For the ether case, the SMARTS pattern would be something like [CH2]-[CH](-O-*)-[CH2], where the O is part of an ether linkage.

But this is too vague. Alternatively, look for a glycerol backbone where one of the oxygens is part of an ether linkage to a long chain.

So, the code would need to:

For the glycerol backbone (three carbons), check if one of the oxygens is connected to a long chain via an ether bond.

This complicates the code further.

Given time constraints and the previous error, perhaps focusing on the two main classes (ethanolamides and monoacylglycerol esters) and handle ethers as a separate case.

But according to the examples, the code must recognize ethers as well.

Thus, the code should check for three types:

1. Ethanolamides with long chains.
2. Glycerol esters with long chains.
3. Glycerol ethers with long chains.

This expands the scope, but the examples include ethers.

So, for ethers:

Check if the glycerol backbone has an ether group (O connected to a carbon chain).

So, in code:

For the glycerol backbone (three carbons), check if any oxygen is connected via an ether (single bond) to a carbon chain.

Then, check the chain length.

But how to differentiate between hydroxyl and ether oxygens.

Hydroxyl oxygen: connected to one carbon and has at least one hydrogen.

Ether oxygen: connected to two carbons.

So, in the glycerol backbone, for each oxygen atom attached to a carbon:

If the oxygen is connected to two carbons (one in the glycerol and one in the chain), it's an ether.

Thus, in code:

For each oxygen attached to the glycerol carbons:

if len(oxygen.GetNeighbors()) == 2:

   then it's part of an ether.

But need to ensure that one neighbor is in the glycerol and the other is in the chain.

Once an ether oxygen is found, check the chain attached to it.

Thus, modifying the monoacylglycerol check to include ethers.

But this increases the complexity.

Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the code that checks for ethanolamides and glycerol esters, and see if it passes the examples, then adjust for ethers.

But the example 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether would be missed.

So, the code needs to handle ethers.

Thus, the code should:

Check for ethanolamide with long chain.

Check for glycerol with ester or ether and long chain.

So, updating the code to include ethers.

For the glycerol part:

Find three carbons with two hydroxyls and one ether or ester.

Thus, in code:

For each three-carbon chain (glycerol_backbone matches):

   count hydroxyls and check for ester/ether.

   hydroxyl_count = 0
   ether_or_ester_count = 0

   for each carbon in the three:
       for neighbor in carbon.GetNeighbors():
           if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8:
               # check if it's hydroxyl, ester, or ether
               if neighbor.GetTotalNumHs() >=1 and len(neighbor.GetNeighbors()) ==1:
                   hydroxyl_count +=1
               else:
                   # check if ester or ether
                   # ester: O connected to C=O
                   # ether: O connected to two carbons
                   if any(nbr.GetAtomicNum() ==6 and nbr.GetIdx() not in three_carbon_indices for nbr in neighbor.GetNeighbors()):
                       # if O is connected to a carbon outside the glycerol, it's ether or ester
                       ether_or_ester_count +=1

   if hydroxyl_count ==2 and ether_or_ester_count ==1:
       # check the chain for ester or ether

But this is getting very complex.

Alternatively, after finding the three-carbon backbone, check each oxygen attached to the carbons:

for each oxygen in the three carbons' neighbors:

   if oxygen is part of an ester or ether:

       then check the chain.

But this requires differentiating between ester and ether.

For ester: oxygen is part of O-C=O.

For ether: oxygen is connected to two carbons, not part of a carbonyl.

Thus, for each oxygen attached to the glycerol carbons:

   if the oxygen is part of an ester group (connected to a carbonyl carbon):

       then it's an ester, check the chain.

   elif the oxygen is part of an ether (connected to two carbons, one in glycerol and one outside):

       then it's an ether, check the chain.

But how to detect this.

For ester:

Check if the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).

For ether:

Check if the oxygen is connected to two carbons, one of which is not part of the glycerol backbone.

Thus, in code:

for each oxygen in the three carbons' neighbors:

   if oxygen.GetAtomicNum() ==8:

       # check for ester
       ester = False
       for nbr in oxygen.GetNeighbors():
           if nbr.GetAtomicNum() ==6 and any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in nbr.GetBonds()):
               ester = True
               break

       if ester:
           # it's an ester, get the carbonyl carbon
           # find the carbonyl carbon connected to this oxygen
           for nbr in oxygen.GetNeighbors():
               if any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in nbr.GetBonds()):
                   carbonyl_c = nbr
                   # get the R group attached to the carbonyl
                   r_group_start = [a for a in carbonyl_c.GetNeighbors() if a != oxygen][0]
                   chain_length = get_chain_length(r_group_start)
                   if chain_length >=12:
                       return True, "Glycerol ester with long chain"
       else:
           # check for ether
           # oxygen is connected to two carbons
           if len(oxygen.GetNeighbors()) ==2:
               # one is part of the glycerol, the other is outside
               other_carbon = None
               for nbr in oxygen.GetNeighbors():
                   if nbr.GetIdx() not in three_carbon_indices:
                       other_carbon = nbr
               if other_carbon is not None:
                   chain_length = get_chain_length(other_carbon)
                   if chain_length >=12:
                       return True, "Glycerol ether with long chain"

This way, both esters and ethers are checked.

But this requires a lot of code and could be error-prone.

Given time constraints, perhaps the code should focus on the main cases (ethanolamides and glycerol esters) and include a check for ethers.

But given the examples provided, the code needs to handle ethers.

Thus, integrating this into the code.

Now, putting all this together.

The final code would:

1. Check for ethanolamide with long chain.

2. Check for glycerol backbone with two hydroxyls and one ester or ether with long chain.

Implementing this would require several nested loops and checks.

But this is necessary to cover all examples.

Now, writing the code with these checks.

Also, handling invalid SMILES.

Finally, testing with the example that caused a timeout.

Palmitoyl ethanolamide: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCO

The code should find the ethanolamide group, check the chain length (16), and return True.

For the ether example: 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether: CCCCOC(CO)CO

The code should find the glycerol backbone (three carbons with two hydroxyls and one ether), check the chain (CCCC) which is 4 carbons. Wait, but this example's SMILES is "CCCCOC(CO)CO". The chain attached to the ether is "CCCC", which is 4 carbons. But according to the examples, this is considered an endocannabinoid, but according to our code, the chain length is only 4, which is less than 12. This indicates a problem.

Wait, no, the example's SMILES for 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether is "CCCCOC(CO)CO", but arachidonyl is a 20-carbon chain. So maybe the SMILES provided in the example is incorrect or abbreviated. Alternatively, perhaps the code's chain length check is too strict.

But according to the problem statement, endocannabinoids have long-chain fatty acids. So, the chain should be at least 12 carbons.

But in the example provided, the chain is only 4 carbons (CCCC). This suggests a discrepancy.

Wait, the example given for 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether is SMILES: "CCCCOC(CO)CO". But arachidonyl is a 20-carbon chain. So this SMILES might be incorrect. Perhaps it's a typo, and the actual chain is longer.

Assuming that the example SMILES is correct, but the code would miss it due to short chain length. However, according to the problem statement, the code should return True for the examples provided.

Thus, the code's chain length requirement of >=12 might be too strict for some cases. But according to the examples, palmitoyl ethanolamide has 16 carbons, which is sufficient. The other examples like anandamide (20 carbons) also meet the requirement.

But if the example for 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether has a short chain, then the code would return False, which is incorrect. This suggests that the chain length check might need to be adjusted.

But according to the definition, endocannabinoids have long chains. So the chain length check is correct. The example SMILES might be incorrect or abbreviated.

Assuming that the examples provided have sufficient chain lengths, the code should work.

In any case, proceeding with the code that checks for ethanolamides and glycerol esters/ethers with chain lengths >=12.

Now, writing the code with these considerations.

Final code:
