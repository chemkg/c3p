</think>

Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was really low, so there must be a lot of false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false positives, some molecules like paclitaxel and alpha-Spinasterol were incorrectly classified. Paclitaxel has a lot of carbons and rings but isn't a triterpenoid. The previous code checked for at least 25 carbons, molecular weight over 400, and ring count >=3. But those criteria are too broad. For example, steroids like alpha-Spinasterol have 27 carbons and multiple rings but are tetracyclic triterpenoids, so maybe the code allowed them. Wait, noâ€”alpha-Spinasterol is a sterol, which is a type of triterpenoid. Hmm, maybe some of the false positives are actually true triterpenoids. But others like the paclitaxel (a taxane diterpenoid) are not. So the previous code's checks were not specific enough.

On the false negatives, some molecules were missed because they had fewer rings. For example, presqualene monophosphate has only 1 ring. But triterpenoids can have various structures. Wait, squalene derivatives are triterpenes but maybe not triterpenoids. Wait, triterpenoids are modified triterpenes. Squalene is a triterpene (C30), but presqualene monophosphate is a C30 precursor. But if the code requires at least 3 rings, then squalene derivatives (which are linear) would be excluded. However, some triterpenoids might have fewer rings if they're heavily modified. So maybe the ring check is too strict.

Another issue: the previous code checked for carbon count >=25, but triterpenoids are derived from C30 triterpenes. Even with modifications (like loss of methyl groups), they should still have around 25-30 carbons. So 25 might be a reasonable lower bound. But some examples in the false negatives, like Picrasin D, have 22 carbons. Wait, why was that considered a false negative? The user-provided examples include structures that are triterpenoids, but maybe Picrasin D isn't. Hmm, perhaps the carbon count check is too strict. Wait, the user's false negatives include presqualene monophosphate, which has a C30 skeleton (squalene is C30), but maybe the code counted carbons incorrectly. For example, if the SMILES includes hydrogens or other atoms, maybe the carbon count is miscalculated. But in the code, it's just counting C atoms in the molecule. Wait, presqualene monophosphate's SMILES has a lot of C's. Let me check: the SMILES is [C@@H]1([C@H](/C=C(/CC/C=C(/CCC=C(C)C)\C)\C)[C@@]1(CC/C=C(/CCC=C(C)C)\C)C)COP(O)(O)=O. That's a lot of carbons. So why was it rejected? The code's carbon count check requires >=25. Let's count: the molecule is presqualene (C30) plus a phosphate. So carbon_count should be 30. But in the false negatives, the reason given was "Only 1 rings, insufficient for triterpenoid structure". Oh right, the code checks for at least 3 rings. But presqualene monophosphate is a linear molecule (squalene is a chain with conjugated double bonds), so it has no rings. Hence, the code rejected it because of the ring count. But triterpenoids are derived from triterpenes, which can be linear (like squalene) or cyclic (like lanosterol). So the code's ring check is incorrect because it's excluding linear triterpenoids.

So the main problem is the ring count check. Triterpenoids can have varying numbers of rings. For example, squalene derivatives are linear (0 rings), while others like lanosterol have multiple rings. The previous code required at least 3 rings, which would exclude any linear triterpenoids, leading to false negatives. However, some of the examples provided (like presqualene monophosphate) are triterpenoids but linear, hence the code missed them.

On the other hand, the false positives were molecules that met the carbon and ring criteria but aren't triterpenoids. For example, paclitaxel is a diterpenoid (C20), but maybe in the test case, it had enough carbons? Wait, paclitaxel's SMILES has a lot of carbons. Let's see: the SMILES includes multiple benzene rings and other structures. The code's carbon count check was >=25. If paclitaxel has, say, 47 carbons (I think it does), then it would pass the carbon check. But it's a diterpene derivative, not a triterpenoid. So the code's criteria are not specific enough.

So to improve, the code needs:

1. Better handling of the carbon count. Triterpenoids are derived from C30 triterpenes. Even with modifications, they should have around 30 carbons, maybe a bit less. The previous code used 25 as a lower bound. Maybe increasing the threshold to 27 or 28 would help exclude some non-triterpenoids.

2. Remove the ring count check. Since some triterpenoids are linear (like squalene derivatives), requiring rings would exclude them. However, this might let in more false positives. Alternatively, find a different structural feature, like the presence of isoprene units or specific terpene-derived skeletons.

3. Check for terpene-like structures. Triterpenoids are derived from triterpenes, which are made of six isoprene units. However, detecting isoprene patterns in RDKit is challenging. Alternatively, look for typical triterpenoid skeletons (like lanostane, oleanane, etc.) using SMARTS patterns. But creating SMARTS for all possible triterpenoid skeletons is difficult.

Alternative approach: Use the molecular formula to check for C30Hx... but modifications (like oxidation, methylation) can change the formula. Maybe check that the number of carbons is at least 27 and molecular weight is above 400, but adjust the thresholds.

Another idea: Use the number of isoprene units. Triterpenes have 6 isoprene units (C5 each, total C30). If the molecule has approximately 30 carbons (maybe 25-35), it could be a triterpenoid. But how to count isoprene units? Not straightforward.

Let me check the examples provided. The user listed several triterpenoids. For example, 25-O-Methylcimigenol has a complex structure with multiple rings. Its SMILES shows a lot of carbons. The molecular formula isn't given, but the code's previous checks would include it (carbons >=25, rings >=3). But presqualene monophosphate, which is a triterpenoid, was excluded due to low ring count.

So the main issue is the ring count. To fix false negatives like presqualene, remove the ring count check. But that might increase false positives. However, the carbon count and molecular weight checks might still filter some non-triterpenoids.

Wait, the previous code had:

- Carbon count >=25
- Mol weight >=400
- Rings >=3

But triterpenoids can have varying structures. Some are linear (0 rings), others have 4-6 rings. So removing the ring count check would allow linear ones but might let in other large molecules.

Alternatively, adjust the ring check to be more lenient. Maybe require at least 1 ring? But that would still exclude linear ones. Alternatively, remove the ring check entirely and rely on carbon count and molecular weight, plus other structural features.

Another approach: Check for the presence of methyl groups attached in a way typical of terpenoids. Triterpenoids often have multiple methyl branches, especially in specific positions. For example, looking for at least 4 methyl groups might help. But how to implement that?

In RDKit, we can count the number of methyl groups (CH3) attached to the main chain. But this might not be reliable.

Alternatively, use the number of methyl groups as a heuristic. Let's see:

For example, squalene has multiple methyl branches. Presqualene monophosphate would have methyl groups. So adding a check for a certain number of methyl groups could help.

But how to count methyl groups in RDKit? A SMARTS pattern for methyl ([CH3] or [CH2] with three bonds) might work.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the previous code's failure points.

The false negatives were due to the ring check. So removing that would help include linear triterpenoids. The false positives might be reduced by increasing the carbon threshold and checking for more structural features.

So revised approach:

1. Increase the minimum carbon count to 27 (since triterpenoids start at C30 but may lose some carbons).

2. Remove the ring count check.

3. Check for molecular weight >=400 (as before).

4. Additionally, check for the presence of at least three methyl groups (common in triterpenoids).

But how to count methyl groups?

Alternatively, check for branched structures by looking for quaternary carbons (atoms with degree >=4). Triterpenoids often have multiple quaternary carbons.

Alternatively, use the number of rotatable bonds. Linear molecules (like squalene) would have many rotatable bonds, while cyclic ones have fewer. But this might not be a reliable indicator.

Alternatively, use a combination of carbon count, molecular weight, and presence of multiple rings or methyl groups.

Another idea: Check if the molecule is derived from a triterpene by looking for the squalene backbone or other triterpene skeletons. But this would require complex SMARTS patterns, which may not cover all cases.

Given time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to adjust the previous code by:

- Removing the ring count check.

- Increasing the carbon threshold to 27.

- Adding a check for molecular weight >= 400.

But let's test with the examples:

Presqualene monophosphate has 30 carbons (from squalene, C30). So carbon_count would be 30, which passes 27. Molecular weight would be higher than 400 (squalene is ~410, plus phosphate adds more). So it would pass. The previous code rejected it because of rings, but with the ring check removed, it would be accepted.

False positives like paclitaxel: Let's see. Paclitaxel has 47 carbons, molecular weight ~853. So it would pass carbon and weight checks. But it's a diterpenoid. So the carbon count check isn't sufficient. Hence, we need another filter.

But how to differentiate diterpenoids (C20) from triterpenoids (C30)? If the code requires at least 27 carbons, then diterpenoids (C20) would be excluded. Wait, paclitaxel is a diterpene but has a lot of carbons due to substitutions. For example, the SMILES includes benzene rings and other groups. So the carbon count in paclitaxel might be higher than 30. Hence, the carbon count check alone isn't sufficient.

Alternative approach: Check if the carbon count is between 27 and 35 (allowing some modifications). But some triterpenoids may have more carbons due to additions (like glycosides). For example, the example Goyasaponin II has a lot of carbons due to sugar groups. So the carbon count could vary widely.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best way is to combine carbon count (>=27), molecular weight (>=400), and check for the presence of at least three methyl groups (as a proxy for terpene origin).

Let's try modifying the code:

1. Remove the ring check.

2. Increase carbon count to >=27.

3. Check molecular weight >=400.

4. Check for at least three methyl groups.

But how to count methyl groups in RDKit?

A methyl group can be detected with the SMARTS pattern [CH3], but in reality, it's any carbon with three single bonds to hydrogens. Alternatively, look for carbons with exactly three Hs attached.

But in SMILES, explicit Hs are not always present. So using the SMARTS [C;D1,D2,D3,D4](H)(H)(H) might not work. Alternatively, look for carbons with degree 1 (but that's a terminal methyl). Wait, a methyl group is a carbon connected to three Hs and one other atom. So in SMARTS, [CH3] would match a carbon with three Hs. But in RDKit, the Hs might not be explicit. So using the SMARTS [C;X4]([H])([H])([H]) might not work. Alternatively, use [C] and check the number of Hs via atom.GetTotalNumHs().

But this could be complicated. Alternatively, count the number of methyl groups using the following SMARTS: [CX4H3]. This matches a carbon with four bonds (including implicit Hs) and three Hs. Wait, the SMARTS [C;H3] would match carbons with three Hs. Let me test:

The SMARTS pattern for a methyl group could be [CH3], but in RDKit, implicit Hs are considered. So the correct SMARTS would be [C;D1]([H])([H])([H])? Not sure. Alternatively, use [C]([H])([H])([H]) but that depends on explicit Hs.

Alternatively, use the following approach:

For each atom in the molecule, if it's a carbon and has exactly three Hs (considering implicit Hs), count it as a methyl group.

In RDKit, atom.GetTotalNumHs() gives the number of Hs attached. So:

methyl_count = 0
for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
    if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and atom.GetTotalNumHs() == 3:
        methyl_count +=1

But this would count any carbon with three Hs, which could be part of a methyl group or other structures. However, triterpenoids often have multiple methyl branches, so requiring at least three might help.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches methyl groups attached to another carbon. For example:

methyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH3]')
methyl_matches = len(mol.GetSubstructMatches(methyl_pattern))

But this depends on how the Hs are represented. If the Hs are implicit, this might not work. To handle implicit Hs, we need to add the Hs first.

Wait, RDKit's MolFromSmiles doesn't include explicit Hs by default. So when using SMARTS, [CH3] would match only if the Hs are explicit. To account for implicit Hs, we need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, use the following SMARTS to match any carbon that is a methyl group, whether Hs are explicit or not: '[C;H3]'. Let's see.

In RDKit, the SMARTS '[C;H3]' should match carbons with three implicit Hs. Let's test:

For a molecule like CCC (propane), the central C has two Hs (degree 2), the end Cs have three Hs each. So '[C;H3]' would match the end Cs.

Yes, this should work. So the SMARTS pattern '[C;H3]' will match carbons with three Hs (i.e., methyl groups).

So in code:

methyl_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C;H3]')
methyl_matches = len(mol.GetSubstructMatches(methyl_pattern))

Then, require methyl_matches >=3.

This could help filter out molecules that don't have enough methyl groups, which are common in triterpenoids.

Putting it all together:

1. Check carbon count >=27.

2. Molecular weight >=400.

3. At least three methyl groups.

4. Remove the ring check.

This might reduce false positives (like paclitaxel, which may not have enough methyl groups) and include linear triterpenoids (like presqualene monophosphate, which has multiple methyl groups).

Testing with the examples:

Presqualene monophosphate: 30 carbons, molecular weight ~410 + phosphate (let's say ~500), methyl groups from the squalene chain. Squalene has multiple methyl branches. So methyl count would be >=3. So it would pass.

Paclitaxel: Let's see. The SMILES has multiple benzene rings and other groups. How many methyl groups? The SMILES has "C(C)=O" (acetyl groups), "C(C)C", etc. It might have some methyl groups, but perhaps not enough. If the code requires at least three, maybe paclitaxel has fewer, thus being excluded.

But I'm not sure. Need to check.

Another example: alpha-Spinasterol (a sterol, which is a triterpenoid). It has a sterol structure with methyl groups. So it would pass the methyl check.

False positives like the carbohydrate molecules (with high carbons but no methyl groups) would be excluded by the methyl check.

So adding the methyl group check could help.

Another adjustment: increase the molecular weight threshold. The previous code used 400, but some triterpenoids (like squalene) have a molecular weight around 410. If modified (e.g., with phosphate), it's higher. So 400 is okay. But some non-triterpenoids with high molecular weight could still pass.

In conclusion, the revised code would:

- Remove the ring check.

- Increase carbon count to >=27.

- Require molecular weight >=400.

- Require at least 3 methyl groups.

This should address the false negatives (like presqualene) and reduce false positives by requiring methyl groups.

Let's implement this.
