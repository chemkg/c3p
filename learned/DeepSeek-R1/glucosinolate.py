Okay, let's figure out why the previous code failed. The main issue was that all the test cases were missing the thioglucose moiety. The error messages indicated that the SMARTS pattern for thioglucose wasn't matching. Let me look at the SMARTS pattern used in the previous code.

The previous pattern was "[C][C@H]1O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O)CO". This seems too specific, requiring a particular stereochemistry that might not account for all variations in the glucose structure. Maybe the glucose part wasn't correctly represented. For example, the SMILES examples have varying hydroxyl positions and stereochemistry. The pattern might be too rigid, expecting exact stereochemistry which isn't present in all cases.

Also, the code checked for sulfur in the thioglucose matches but didn't properly locate where the sulfur is connected. The glucose moiety in glucosinolates has a sulfur atom replacing the oxygen in the glycosidic bond. So perhaps the SMARTS should look for a sulfur connected to the glucose's anomeric carbon.

Another thing: the sulfonated oxime group pattern might not be matching correctly. The previous code used "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]-S(=O)(=O)[O-]", but in some examples, the oxime's oxygen is directly bonded to sulfur (like O-SO3). Maybe the SMARTS needs to account for that connectivity.

Additionally, the stereochemistry check might be insufficient. The problem states that the side-chain and sulfate have an anti configuration across C=N. The code checked for any stereo bond, but maybe it needs to ensure the specific anti arrangement.

So, to fix this:

1. Redesign the thioglucose SMARTS to look for a sulfur atom attached to the glucose's anomeric carbon (C1 in the pyranose ring). The glucose part should be more flexible in stereochemistry.

2. Adjust the sulfonated oxime pattern to match either O-SO3 or direct S connection.

3. Ensure the sulfur from thioglucose is connected to the central carbon of the C=N group.

4. Improve the stereochemistry check to verify the anti configuration between the side chain and sulfonate group.

Let me adjust the SMARTS for thioglucose. The correct structure is a beta-thioglucose, where the sulfur is attached to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the glucose. The glucose should be in a pyranose form. So the SMARTS pattern should look for a six-membered ring (pyranose) with an S attached to C1. Also, the hydroxyl groups might have varying stereochemistry, so using a more general pattern with possible any configuration.

Maybe the pattern can be "[SX2][C@H]1O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O)CO". Wait, but some examples have the sulfur connected via a single bond, like S/C(=N...). So perhaps the sulfur is part of a thioether linkage.

Alternatively, use a pattern that finds a sulfur atom connected to a carbon that's part of a hexose (like glucose) structure. Maybe using a generic hexose pattern with S instead of O in the glycosidic bond.

For the sulfonated oxime, perhaps the pattern should be "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]S(=O)(=O)[O-]". Let me check the examples. For instance, in glucobrassicanapin, the group is S/C(=N\OS([O-])(=O)=O)/... So the oxime is C=N-O-SO3. The SMARTS should match that.

Also, in the previous code, the way the thioglucose sulfur is connected to the central carbon wasn't correctly checked. The central carbon is the one in the C=N group. So the sulfur from thioglucose should be bonded to that carbon.

Another issue might be the handling of charges. The examples have [O-], but the SMARTS should account for possible charges.

Let me try to adjust the thioglucose pattern to be more flexible. Instead of requiring specific stereochemistry, use a more general pyranose ring with sulfur attached. Maybe:

thiogluc_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[SX2][C@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O")

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, look for a sulfur connected to a carbon that's part of a six-membered ring with multiple hydroxyl groups and a hydroxymethyl group (for the glucose part).

Also, in the previous code, the thiogluc_s was collected from the matches, but maybe the sulfur is part of the thioglucose structure. For example, in the SMILES S(C1OC(...))CO, the sulfur is attached to the C1 of the glucose.

So the correct SMARTS might be "[SX2]C1OC([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O)CO" to capture the sulfur connected to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the glucose.

Wait, in the example SMILES like [C@H]1(O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)...)CO)S/C(=N...), the sulfur is attached to the C1 of the glucose (the first carbon in the ring). So the SMARTS should look for a sulfur connected to C1 of the glucose ring.

The glucose ring is a pyranose (six-membered), so the SMARTS pattern should be something like:

[C@H]1(O[C@@H](...)[C@H](O)...)CO where the sulfur is attached to C1.

Alternatively, using a SMARTS that matches the glucose backbone with a sulfur at the anomeric position. Maybe:

thiogluc_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[SX2][C@H]1O[C@@H]([C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O)CO")

But the stereodescriptors might vary. So perhaps making the stereochemistry optional or using more generic patterns.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches the sulfur connected to a carbon in a six-membered ring with multiple hydroxyl groups and a hydroxymethyl group (CO), which is the glucose part.

Let me try a SMARTS like:

"[SX2]C1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)CO"

This would match a sulfur (S) connected to a carbon (C1), which is part of a six-membered ring (C1OC(...)), with hydroxyl groups and a hydroxymethyl (CO) group. This might capture the thioglucose moiety without requiring specific stereochemistry.

If that's the case, then the previous code's thiogluc_pattern was too strict on stereochemistry, leading to no matches. By relaxing the stereochemistry in the SMARTS, more examples would match.

Once the thioglucose is correctly identified, the rest of the checks (sulfonated oxime, connectivity, stereochemistry) can proceed.

Another possible issue is that the previous code's sulfonated oxime pattern didn't account for the exact structure. For example, the group is C=N-O-SO3^-. The SMARTS should be "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]S(=O)(=O)[O-]".

In the previous code, the first pattern was "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]-S(=O)(=O)[O-]", which would require a bond between O and S. But in reality, the O is part of the sulfonate group. Wait, no: in the SMILES, it's O-S(=O)(=O)[O-]. So the correct SMARTS would be "[CX3]=[NX2]-O-S(=O)(=O)[O-]".

Wait, looking at an example SMILES: S/C(=N\OS([O-])(=O)=O)/CCCC=C. The oxime part is C(=N\OS(...)), so the structure is C=N-O-SO3^-.

So the sulfonated oxime group is connected as C=N-O-SO3. Therefore, the SMARTS should be "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]S(=O)(=O)[O-]".

But in SMILES, the O is connected to S, so the SMARTS pattern should be "[CX3]=[NX2]-O-S(=O)(=O)[O-]".

In the previous code, the first pattern was "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]-S(=O)(=O)[O-]", which has an extra hyphen, making it O connected to S. But perhaps the correct SMARTS is "[CX3]=[NX2]-O-S(=O)(=O)[O-]".

Wait, the hyphen in SMARTS denotes single bonds. So "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]-S(=O)(=O)[O-]" would require C=N-O-S. But in reality, the O is part of the sulfonate group, so it's O-S. So that pattern is correct.

But in the example SMILES, the oxime is written as N\OS(...), which is N-O-S. So the SMARTS should match that.

So the previous code's first pattern should have worked. But maybe the charge was not accounted for. The SMILES examples have [O-], so the SMARTS should include that. The pattern "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]-S(=O)(=O)[O-]" should match.

But in the previous code, the code first checked for that pattern, and if not found, tried another pattern "[CX3]=[NX2]-[OX2]S(=O)(=O)[O-]" (without the hyphen between O and S). Wait, that's a mistake. The hyphen in SMARTS indicates a single bond. So the correct SMARTS for O-S would be "-", so the first pattern is correct, and the second pattern (without the hyphen) is incorrect.

So the code's second attempt was wrong. That might have caused some mismatches.

Another issue is the stereochemistry check. The previous code checked if the C=N bond has any stereo (not STEREONONE), but the problem states that the side chain and sulfonate must be anti. So the configuration should be trans. The code didn't check for the specific stereo configuration.

In SMILES, the configuration is indicated with / and \. For example, in S/C(=N\OS...)/..., the C=N double bond has a specific configuration. The code needs to ensure that the substituents on the C and N are anti.

But checking this with RDKit might be tricky. Perhaps using the bond's stereo direction and ensuring that the side chain and sulfonate group are on opposite sides.

Alternatively, since the code can't easily determine the spatial arrangement, maybe relying on the presence of any double bond stereo (E or Z) is sufficient, as the definition states it's anti. But this might not be accurate. However, given the examples, many have the \ and / indicators, so the presence of stereo is necessary.

In the previous code, the check was for any stereo on the C=N bond, which might not be sufficient. But according to the error messages, the main issue was the thioglucose pattern.

So, the key fix is to correct the thioglucose SMARTS pattern. Let's adjust that.

Proposed changes:

1. Revise the thioglucose SMARTS to look for a sulfur connected to a glucose-like structure. Use a more flexible pattern that doesn't enforce specific stereochemistry but captures the essential features: a pyranose ring with multiple hydroxyls, a hydroxymethyl group (CO), and a sulfur attached to the anomeric carbon.

Possible SMARTS: "[SX2]C1OC([CX4H][CX4H]O)C(O)C(O)C1O"

Wait, perhaps better to use:

"[SX2]C1OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C1O"

But maybe that's too generic. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches the thioglucose as a sulfur connected to a carbon in a six-membered oxygen ring (pyranose) with multiple hydroxyls and a CH2OH group.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches the core structure of beta-thioglucose, which is S attached to C1 of a pyranose ring with specific substituents.

But given that the examples have varying stereochemistry, perhaps a more general approach is needed. Let's look at one of the example SMILES:

For glucobrassicanapin(1-): SMILES: [C@H]1(O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)O)CO)S/C(=N\OS([O-])(=O)=O)/CCCC=C

The thioglucose part is [C@H]1(O[C@@H](...)CO)S... So the sulfur is attached to C1 of the glucose ring. The glucose ring is in a certain configuration, but the SMARTS should capture that the S is connected to C1 of a pyranose ring with multiple hydroxyls and a CH2OH group.

So the SMARTS pattern could be "[SX2][C@H]1O[C@@H]([C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O)CO", but allowing for different stereochemistry by removing the stereodescriptors.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that ignores stereochemistry:

"[SX2]C1OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C1O"

This would match a sulfur connected to a carbon (C1) in a six-membered ring (O-C-O-C-O-C), but this might not capture the pyranose correctly. Maybe better to use:

"[SX2][C;H1]1O[C;H1][C;H1](O)[C;H1](O)[C;H1]1O)CO"

Not sure. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that looks for a six-membered ring (pyranose) with S attached to C1, and the CO (hydroxymethyl) group at C5.

Perhaps the correct approach is to use a SMARTS that matches the sulfur connected to the anomeric carbon (C1) of a glucose-like pyranose ring, regardless of stereochemistry. So:

thiogluc_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[SX2]C1OCC(O)C(O)C1O")

But I'm not confident. Let's test this with one of the example SMILES.

Take the first example: [C@H]1(O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)O)CO)S/C(=N\OS([O-])(=O)=O)/CCCC=C

The sulfur is attached to C1 of the ring. The ring is O[C@@H](...), so the SMARTS should match the S connected to C1, which is part of a ring with O, C, etc.

Maybe the correct SMARTS is "[SX2]C1OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C1O". Let's break it down:

- S connected to C1
- C1 is part of a ring (C1O...)
- The ring has O, C, etc.

But perhaps using a more generic approach: any six-membered ring where S is attached to one of the carbons, and the ring has multiple hydroxyls and a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, use the SMARTS pattern for beta-D-thioglucose, which has the sulfur in the beta position. But stereochemistry might vary in examples.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use a SMARTS pattern that matches the sulfur connected to a glucose backbone without enforcing specific stereochemistry. For example:

thiogluc_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[SX2]C1O[C@@H](*)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O")

But this is still too specific. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that looks for a sulfur connected to a carbon that's part of a six-membered ring with multiple hydroxyl groups and a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group.

Another approach: the thioglucose moiety is a glucose where the oxygen in the glycosidic bond is replaced by sulfur. So the general structure is S-C6H10O5-CH2OH. The SMARTS should capture the sulfur connected to the anomeric carbon (C1) of a pyranose ring with hydroxyls at positions 2, 3, 4, and 6 (hydroxymethyl).

But constructing such a SMARTS is complex. Maybe using a more generic pattern:

"[SX2][C@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O"

This matches S attached to C1, which is part of a pyranose ring with O at C2, hydroxyls at C3, C4, and C6 (CO). But this requires specific stereochemistry, which may not be present in all cases.

Given that the previous code's thiogluc_pattern was too strict, perhaps the solution is to remove the stereochemistry from the SMARTS and make it more general. For example:

thiogluc_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[SX2]C1OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C1O")

This would match a sulfur connected to C1 of a six-membered ring (O-C-O-C-O-C), with hydroxymethyl (CO) and hydroxyl groups. This pattern might capture the thioglucose moiety without requiring specific stereochemistry.

Testing this with the example SMILES:

For glucobrassicanapin(1-), the S is attached to C1 of the ring. The ring has O's and hydroxyls. This SMARTS should match.

If this works, then the code can proceed. Otherwise, further adjustments are needed.

Another possible issue is that the code checks for the sulfur in the thioglucose matches but doesn't properly link it to the central carbon in the oxime group.

Once the thioglucose is correctly identified, the code should check that the sulfur from the thioglucose is bonded to the central carbon (C in C=N-O-SO3).

In the previous code, after finding the oxime matches, it loops through the C atoms in those matches and checks if any neighbor is the thioglucose S. This should work if the SMARTS for oxime is correct.

Putting it all together, the revised code should:

1. Use a more general thioglucose SMARTS that matches S connected to a glucose-like structure.
2. Correctly identify the sulfonated oxime group.
3. Ensure connectivity between thioglucose S and oxime C.
4. Check for stereochemistry on the C=N bond.
5. Verify the presence of a side chain.

Now, let's draft the revised code with these adjustments.
