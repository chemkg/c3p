Okay, let's try to figure out why the previous code failed. The error mentioned was "unexpected indent" on line 1. Looking at the previous code, it seems like the code block wasn't properly formatted. The user probably included a list of SMILES strings inside the code block, which isn't valid Python. That's why the parser threw an error. 

Now, focusing on the task: classifying azoles. The definition says azoles are monocyclic five-membered heteroarenes with at least one nitrogen, possibly including other heteroatoms like S or O. So the key points are:

1. **Monocyclic**: Only one ring, no fused rings.
2. **Five-membered**: Exactly 5 atoms in the ring.
3. **Heteroarene**: Aromatic ring with at least one heteroatom (N, S, O).
4. **At least one nitrogen** in the ring, possibly others.

The previous code might have missed checking for the ring being monocyclic and exactly five-membered. Also, ensuring aromaticity is important. Let's structure the code step by step.

First, parse the SMILES. Then, check if there's exactly one ring with 5 atoms. Ensure that ring is aromatic and contains at least one nitrogen. Also, verify there are no fused rings (so the molecule is monocyclic). Let's use RDKit's ring detection and atom queries.

So, the steps in code would be:

1. Convert SMILES to a molecule.
2. Check for exactly one ring of size 5.
3. Ensure the ring is aromatic.
4. Check that the ring contains at least one nitrogen atom.
5. Verify that the ring is monocyclic (no fused rings).

Let me draft the code with these checks. Use SMARTS patterns for the aromatic five-membered ring with at least one nitrogen. Also, check that the entire ring is part of a single ring system to avoid fused rings.

Wait, how to check for fused rings? Maybe by ensuring that all atoms in the ring are in only one ring. For each atom in the five-membered ring, check that they belong to only one ring. That way, if any atom is part of another ring, it's fused.

Putting it all together. Also, handle invalid SMILES. Let's test with the examples provided. For instance, clotrimazole has a benzene ring attached but the azole ring itself is monocyclic. The code should detect that.

So the code would:

- Find all 5-membered aromatic rings.
- Check if any of them is a monocyclic ring with at least one N.
- If such a ring exists, return True.

Now, writing the code with these steps.
