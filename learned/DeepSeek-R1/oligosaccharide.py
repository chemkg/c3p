Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The main issue was that it had a low F1 score, meaning it both missed some true oligosaccharides (false negatives) and incorrectly classified some non-oligosaccharides as oligosaccharides (false positives).

Looking at the false positives, some molecules were wrongly identified because they had oxygen-containing rings that aren't sugars. For example, structures with non-sugar rings like benzene derivatives with oxygen might have been counted as sugar rings. The previous code checked for any oxygen in a 5 or 6-membered ring, but that's too broad. Real monosaccharides have specific patterns, like multiple hydroxyl groups and a cyclic hemiacetal structure.

For the false negatives, some actual oligosaccharides were missed. The code counted glycosidic bonds by checking oxygen atoms connecting different rings. But maybe some glycosidic bonds weren't detected because the approach missed certain linkages, like when the oxygen is part of a bridge but not correctly identified. Also, the code required exactly len(sugar_rings)-1 bonds, but some valid oligosaccharides might have branches, leading to more bonds than that. For example, a trisaccharide with two bonds (linear) versus a branched one with three bondsâ€”both are valid, but the code might reject the latter.

Another problem was detecting sugar rings. The previous method looked for any 5/6-membered ring with an oxygen, but real sugars have more specific features. For instance, pyranoses (6-membered) and furanoses (5-membered) have multiple hydroxyl groups and a specific arrangement. The code didn't check for these features, leading to incorrect ring identification.

To fix this, I need to improve how sugar rings are detected. Instead of just checking for any oxygen in the ring, I should look for rings where most atoms are oxygen or have hydroxyl groups. Also, using SMARTS patterns to match known monosaccharide structures would be more accurate.

For glycosidic bonds, the previous approach counted oxygen atoms connecting different rings, but maybe some linkages were missed. Using SMARTS to find the specific glycosidic linkage pattern (like C-O-C between two sugar rings) might be better. Also, considering that each sugar unit can have multiple linkages (like in branched oligosaccharides) would help avoid missing valid cases.

Additionally, the code didn't account for substituents like N-acetyl groups (common in modified sugars like GlcNAc). The previous approach might have missed these as valid parts of the sugar unit.

So, the revised plan is:

1. Use SMARTS patterns to accurately identify monosaccharide rings, considering hydroxyl groups and ring oxygen.
2. Use SMARTS to detect glycosidic bonds (C-O-C between two sugar rings).
3. Count the number of valid sugar units and glycosidic bonds, ensuring that the number of bonds is at least one less than the number of sugars (allowing for branches).
4. Check for other features like multiple hydroxyl groups and typical substituents on the sugars.

This should reduce false positives by better identifying true sugar rings and false negatives by accurately counting glycosidic bonds even in branched structures.
