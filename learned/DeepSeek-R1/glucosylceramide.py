Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The error mentioned was an f-string issue, but looking at the code, I see that in the fatty_acid_length part, there's a line using curly braces with {fatty_acid_length-2},}. Oh wait, the syntax here is wrong. The code uses an f-string inside an SMARTS pattern but didn't properly format it. The line should be f"[...]{'{'}{fatty_acid_length-2},}}", but the way the curly braces are escaped is incorrect. That's probably causing a syntax error.

Also, looking at the test results, all cases failed. So even if the syntax was fixed, there might be other issues. Let's check the substructure patterns.

First, the glucose pattern: the SMARTS for beta-D-glucopyranose might not match all variations. Maybe the stereochemistry isn't correctly specified, or the ring structure isn't captured properly.

The glycosidic bond check uses a specific pattern that might not account for different connectivity. For example, the glucose is connected via an oxygen to the ceramide's sphingosine part. The current pattern might be too strict.

The sphingosine_pattern uses [C]([OH])[C]([NH]), which is too vague. Sphingosine typically has a specific structure: a long chain with an amino group and hydroxyl groups in certain positions. The previous pattern might miss this.

The amide check is looking for an amide group connected to a long chain. But in the examples, the amide is part of the fatty acid linked to the sphingosine. The code's way of checking the chain length (using SMARTS with {12,}) might not work correctly, especially if the chain is branched or has double bonds.

Let's address these issues step by step.

1. **Fix the f-string syntax error**: Replace the problematic line with proper string formatting. Instead of trying to use a variable inside the SMARTS, maybe use a different approach to check chain length.

2. **Improve glucose detection**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern for beta-D-glucose that accounts for the pyranose form and the correct stereochemistry.

3. **Check glycosidic bond correctly**: Ensure the glucose is connected via an oxygen to the ceramide part. Look for the glucose's anomeric carbon (C1) connected via an O to another atom.

4. **Refine ceramide detection**: The ceramide consists of a sphingosine base (long chain with amino and hydroxyl groups) linked via an amide to a fatty acid. Need to ensure both parts are present with sufficient chain lengths.

5. **Chain length checks**: Instead of relying on SMARTS with variable lengths, use RDKit's functions to traverse the carbon chains from the amide nitrogen and sphingosine to determine lengths.

So, revising the code:

- Use `MolFromSmarts` for glucose with correct stereochemistry.
- Find the glycosidic oxygen by checking the connection between glucose and the rest of the molecule.
- For the fatty acid, check that the amide is attached to a chain of at least 12 carbons.
- For sphingosine, check for a long chain with both amino and hydroxyl groups, ensuring adequate length.

Also, the previous code's sphingosine_pattern was too generic. Instead, look for a structure where the amide's nitrogen is connected to a carbon chain with a hydroxyl group.

Another thing: in the examples, the glucose is connected via an oxygen (glycosidic bond) to the ceramide. The ceramide part has the sphingosine (with NH and OH) and the fatty acid as an amide.

Let me adjust the patterns and checks accordingly. Also, fix the chain length check by traversing the atoms instead of using SMARTS with variable repetitions, which can be error-prone.

Now, let's implement these changes in the code.
