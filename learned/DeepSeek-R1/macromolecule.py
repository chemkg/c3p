Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The error message says that 'rdMolDescriptors' doesn't have 'CalcNumUniqueBranchedSubstructs'. Oh right, maybe that function doesn't exist in RDKit. I should check the RDKit documentation. Hmm, looking it up... Yeah, I don't see that function. So the code tried to use a non-existent method, which caused an error. That line needs to be removed or replaced.

Looking at the previous approach: the code checked molecular weight, amide bonds for proteins, glycosidic bonds for polysaccharides, and then tried this unique branched substructures thing. But since that function isn't available, that part is broken. Also, maybe the criteria weren't sufficient. For example, some macromolecules might not have enough amide or glycosidic bonds but still be large polymers.

Let me think about alternative ways to detect repeating units. Maybe look for repeating patterns using SMARTS or check for multiple occurrences of certain functional groups that indicate polymers. For example, proteins have multiple amide bonds (like the peptide backbone), polysaccharides have multiple glycosidic bonds, and synthetic polymers might have repeating units connected by specific linkages.

Another approach: check if the molecule has a high number of repeating subunits. But how to detect that programmatically? Maybe using SMARTS to find repeating motifs. However, that's tricky because the exact pattern can vary. Alternatively, use the number of rotatable bonds as a proxy for chain length, but that's not reliable.

Wait, the initial examples given are mostly peptides and glycans. So focusing on proteins and polysaccharides might cover many cases. The previous code checked for amide bonds (>=10) and glycosidic bonds (>=6). But maybe the thresholds are too strict. For example, a small peptide might have 5 amide bonds but not be a macromolecule. However, the molecular weight check (>=500) could help. But the examples include molecules with high molecular weights.

Another issue: the code returned False for the test case, which was a peptide (Holrhizin O). Let's see: the SMILES has multiple amide groups. The code checks for amide_pattern as "[CX3][CX3](=[OX1])[NX3H]". Wait, that pattern might not capture all amide bonds. The standard peptide bond is CONH, but in SMILES, the nitrogen might be part of a ring or have different substituents. Maybe the SMARTS pattern is too restrictive. For example, in the test case, the amide groups might not have the exact [NX3H] because the nitrogen is connected to other atoms (like in proline). So the pattern might miss some amides.

Ah, that's a problem. The amide pattern should match any amide group, including those where the nitrogen is part of a ring or has substituents. The current pattern requires a hydrogen on the nitrogen, which isn't the case in secondary amides (like in proline). So the SMARTS should be adjusted to allow any amide, regardless of substitution. Maybe using "[CX3][CX3](=[OX1])[NX3]" instead, without requiring the hydrogen.

Similarly, for glycosidic bonds, the pattern "[C&r][OX2;!$(O=C)][C&r]" looks for two ring carbons connected by an oxygen that's not part of an ester. But maybe that's too narrow. Alternatively, look for any ether linkage between two sugars (but how to define that?).

Also, the code's fallback for molecular weight over 3000 might not have been triggered if the test case's molecule is below that. For example, the first example (Holrhizin O) has a molecular weight that might be above 500 but below 3000. Let me calculate it: the SMILES is O=C(O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)... etc. Let's see, each amino acid residue adds about 100-200 g/mol. If there are 7 residues (as in the example), maybe around 800-1000 Da. So the molecular weight check of 500 is passed, but the amide count might not reach 10. Let's count the amide bonds in that SMILES. Each NC(=O) is an amide. The SMILES has multiple NC(=O) groups. Let's see: the SMILES starts with O=C(O)... then NC(=O)... that's one. Then another NC(=O), etc. Let's count:

Each occurrence of NC(=O) is an amide. The example SMILES has 6 NC(=O) groups (each amino acid after the first contributes one). So the amide_count would be 6. The previous code required >=10, which would miss this. So the threshold was too high. Lowering it to 5 or 6 might help.

So the main issues are:

1. The use of a non-existent RDKit function (CalcNumUniqueBranchedSubstructs), which caused an error.
2. The amide SMARTS pattern was too restrictive, missing some amide bonds.
3. The amide count threshold was too high (10), leading to false negatives for smaller peptides.
4. The glycosidic pattern might not be accurate enough.
5. The molecular weight threshold for the fallback (3000) might be too high.

To fix this:

- Remove the line using CalcNumUniqueBranchedSubstructs.
- Adjust the amide SMARTS pattern to capture more cases.
- Lower the amide count threshold.
- Possibly adjust the glycosidic pattern.
- Consider other polymer indicators, like multiple ester groups (for polyesters) or other repeating units.
- Add checks for other types of repeating structures.

Let's revise the code accordingly. For proteins, look for multiple amide bonds. For polysaccharides, multiple glycosidic bonds. For other polymers, maybe check for repeating units via SMARTS or high molecular weight with many similar groups.

Testing with the example SMILES: O=C(O)[C@@H](NC(=O)... which has 6 amide bonds. If we lower the threshold to 5, it would trigger. Also, using a more permissive amide pattern.

Another approach: calculate the number of peptide bonds (amide linkages between amino acids), but that's more complex. Alternatively, just count all amide groups regardless of context.

So the revised code would:

- Check molecular weight >= 500 Da.
- Check for >=5 amide bonds (adjusted pattern).
- Check for >=4 glycosidic bonds.
- If molecular weight is very high (e.g., >=3000), consider it a macromolecule.
- Remove the faulty unique substructures check.

Let's implement these changes.
