Okay, let's figure out why the previous code failed. The main issue was that all the test cases were missing the furan-like ring detection. Looking at the error messages, the examples like azadirachtin H and Limonexic acid were rejected because the code didn't find a furan ring. But wait, some of these SMILES do have furan rings. For example, azadirachtin H's SMILES has "c1ccoc1" which is a furan. So why didn't the pattern match?

Looking at the furan_pattern in the previous code: it used '[O;r5]1:[c,c,C;r5]:[c,c,C;r5]:[c,c,C;r5]:[c,c,C;r5]:1'. The 'r5' means the atoms are in a 5-membered ring. But maybe the SMARTS pattern is too restrictive. The 'O' in the furan might not be correctly matched because of aromaticity or substitution. Also, using 'c' (aromatic) vs 'C' (aliphatic) could be an issue. Some furans in the examples might have substituents that make the ring non-aromatic or have different bonding.

Another problem could be that the furan might be part of a larger ring system. The previous pattern looks for a standalone 5-membered ring with O, but in reality, the furan might be fused or part of a more complex structure. The SMARTS pattern should account for that.

Let me adjust the furan pattern. Instead of requiring all atoms to be in a 5-membered ring (which might not be the case if fused), maybe just look for a 5-membered ring with one oxygen and four carbons, allowing any connectivity. A better SMARTS could be 'o1cccc1' which matches aromatic furan rings. But RDKit uses lowercase 'o' for aromatic oxygen. Wait, in SMILES, furan is written as 'c1coccc1', so the oxygen is in an aromatic ring. The previous pattern used 'O;r5' which is an aliphatic oxygen in a 5-membered ring. That's the mistake! The furan oxygen should be aromatic (lowercase 'o'), so the SMARTS should use 'o' instead of 'O'.

So the correct furan pattern should be '[o]1[c,c][c,c][c,c][c,c]1' or similar, allowing for aromatic oxygen. Let me adjust that. Also, the previous pattern required all atoms to be in a 5-membered ring, but maybe that's not necessary if the furan is part of a fused system. So a better approach is to search for any 5-membered ring containing an oxygen atom, regardless of aromaticity, but more likely aromatic.

Wait, but in SMILES, furan is represented with lowercase 'o' and aromatic carbons. So the SMARTS should look for an aromatic oxygen in a 5-membered ring. Let's try using 'o1cccc1' as the SMARTS pattern, which matches an aromatic furan ring. Alternatively, using a more flexible pattern that allows any substitution but requires the O in a 5-membered ring.

Another possibility is that the furan is part of a substituent, like a furyl group. For example, the SMILES might have a fragment like C=COC or similar. Wait, looking at the example SMILES for azadirachtin H: it has "c1ccoc1" which is a furan ring. The previous code's SMARTS pattern was looking for O in a 5-membered ring with explicit ring membership, but maybe the aromaticity wasn't considered. So changing the O to lowercase 'o' in the SMARTS would correctly match aromatic oxygen in a furan.

So the fix is to adjust the furan_pattern to account for aromatic oxygen. Let's revise the SMARTS to '[o]1[c,C]~[c,C]~[c,C]~[c,C]~1' which allows aromatic oxygen and any carbon types (aromatic or aliphatic) in the ring. Using '~' for any bond type. Alternatively, use '[o]1cccc1' but that requires aromatic carbons. Maybe better to use a more general pattern.

Also, in some cases, the furan might have substituents. The previous pattern required all atoms in the ring to be part of the 5-membered ring, but if the furan is fused, that's not the case. So perhaps the pattern should look for any 5-membered ring containing an oxygen, regardless of other ring memberships.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that finds any 5-membered ring with one oxygen and four carbons, allowing any substitutions. For example: '[r5]1:[o]:[c,C]:[c,C]:[c,C]:[c,C]:1' but I'm not sure. Maybe better to use a simpler approach: look for any occurrence of a furan ring, whether fused or not.

Let me test the corrected furan_pattern. Changing 'O' to 'o' in the SMARTS. So the new pattern would be '[o]1[c,C][c,C][c,C][c,C]1' allowing aromatic oxygen and any carbons (aromatic or aliphatic). Also, using 'c,C' to match both aromatic and aliphatic carbons.

Additionally, some furan rings might have substituents, so the pattern should allow for that. The previous pattern was too strict. Let's use a more flexible SMARTS like 'o1ccc([!O])c1' but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, use 'o1cccc1' which matches any aromatic furan ring.

Another point: the previous code checked for 'furan-like' but maybe missed some cases where the oxygen is part of a larger ring system. For example, if the furan is fused with other rings, the 'r5' condition might not hold. So removing the 'r5' restriction on the oxygen and just looking for a 5-membered ring with an oxygen.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches any 5-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. The pattern could be '[#8;r5]' but that would include any oxygen in a 5-membered ring, not necessarily a furan. But limonoids specifically have a furan ring, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Wait, the definition says "4,4,8-trimethyl-17-furanylsteroid skeleton". The furan is a substituent (furanyl), so it's a separate ring. So the furan is likely a standalone ring, not fused. Therefore, the original approach of looking for a 5-membered ring with oxygen should work, but the issue was using aliphatic O instead of aromatic o.

So the correct SMARTS should be '[o]1[c,C][c,C][c,C][c,C]1' to match an aromatic oxygen in a 5-membered ring with four carbons. Let's adjust that.

Testing this: for the SMILES 'c1ccoc1', the pattern '[o]1cccc1' would match. So in the code, changing the furan_pattern to Chem.MolFromSmarts('o1cccc1') would correctly identify the furan.

Another example: 'C=7C=COC7' in some SMILES. That part is 'C=C1OC=C1', which is a furan-like structure. Wait, no: 'C=COC' would form a 5-membered ring if connected properly. But in any case, using the aromatic oxygen in the SMARTS should catch the furan rings.

Once the furan pattern is fixed, the code should correctly identify the presence of the furan ring in the examples. Then, the other checks (oxygen count, molecular weight, etc.) can proceed.

Another possible issue: the oxygen count check. Limonoids have high oxygenation, but maybe some examples have exactly 6 oxygens. The previous code required at least 6, which should be okay. The molecular weight check had a lower limit of 450, which might be too low. Some limonoids are larger, but maybe some examples are smaller. However, the main issue was the furan detection.

So the main correction is to fix the furan_pattern to use aromatic oxygen (lowercase 'o') and adjust the SMARTS accordingly. Let's modify the code to use 'o' in the furan pattern.

Also, in the previous code, the furan_pattern was written with 'O;r5', which is an aliphatic oxygen in a 5-membered ring. Changing that to 'o' (aromatic) and adjusting the SMARTS to match the furan structure correctly.

Revised furan_pattern: Chem.MolFromSmarts('[o]1[c,C][c,C][c,C][c,C]1') or more precisely 'o1cccc1'.

Testing this should allow the code to detect the furan rings in the examples. Once that's fixed, the other checks can proceed, and the true positives would be correctly identified.
