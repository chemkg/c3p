Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The error mentioned was "unexpected indent" which usually means there's a spacing issue in the code. Looking at the example provided for triglyceride, the code structure seems correct with proper indentation. But in the user's previous attempt, maybe there were some misplaced lines or incorrect formatting. Also, the F1 score was 0, meaning the code didn't correctly classify any monosaccharides.

Now, focusing on the problem: we need to write a function to check if a molecule is a monosaccharide based on the given definition. Monosaccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones with at least three carbons. They should have a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone) and multiple hydroxyl groups. Also, they shouldn't have glycosidic bonds (like in oligosaccharides or polysaccharides), so there should be no ether or acetal linkages except possibly in cyclic forms.

First, parse the SMILES into a molecule. If it's invalid, return False. Then, check for the presence of a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone). Aldehydes are -CHO, and ketones are C=O with two carbons attached. Next, ensure there are at least three hydroxyl groups (OH). Also, the molecule should have at least three carbon atoms. Additionally, check that there are no glycosidic bonds, which are typically ether linkages (C-O-C) that aren't part of the cyclic hemiacetal/hemiketal structure. However, cyclic forms have such linkages as part of the ring, so maybe we need to differentiate between intra-ring and inter-ring ethers. But that might be complex. Alternatively, ensure that all oxygen atoms are either in hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, or part of a ring (like in cyclic forms). Also, deoxy sugars are allowed as long as they have a potential carbonyl group.

So, steps:
1. Check valid SMILES.
2. Check for aldehyde or ketone group (current or potential, like in cyclic forms where the carbonyl might be converted into a hemiacetal).
3. Count hydroxyl groups (must have at least two, but according to examples, maybe more).
4. Ensure at least three carbons.
5. Check for glycosidic bonds (absence of ethers except those in rings? Not sure. Maybe count the number of ether oxygens and ensure they are part of rings.)

Wait, cyclic monosaccharides form rings via hemiacetal/hemiketal bonds, which involve an oxygen in the ring. So in cyclic forms, there's an oxygen connecting two carbons in a ring. But glycosidic bonds are when another sugar is attached via an oxygen, which would be an ether linkage outside the ring. So perhaps checking that there's only one such ring oxygen and no other ethers.

But how to detect that? Maybe check that all ether oxygens (C-O-C) are part of a ring. Alternatively, ensure that there are no non-ring ether oxygens. But this could be tricky.

Alternatively, the definition says "without glycosidic connection to other such units", so the molecule should be a single unit. So, if there's an ether linkage (C-O-C) that's not part of a ring, it's a glycosidic bond and thus not a monosaccharide. So, check that any ether oxygens are part of a ring.

So, steps:

- Find all ether oxygens (O connected to two carbons). For each such oxygen, check if it's in a ring. If any are not in a ring, it's a glycosidic bond → reject.

Also, check for the presence of a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone). But in cyclic forms, the carbonyl is converted into a hemiacetal, so the actual structure might not have a carbonyl. So how to handle that? The definition mentions "parent monosaccharides" which have the carbonyl, and derivatives like deoxy sugars as long as the parent has a potential carbonyl. So maybe the code should check for either a current carbonyl group or a structure that can tautomerize to have one (like cyclic hemiacetals which can open to form the carbonyl).

But detecting potential carbonyls is tricky. Maybe we can look for either an existing aldehyde/ketone or a ring structure that could open to form one. For example, in cyclic forms like glucose, the ring oxygen is part of a hemiacetal which can open to form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, use the Murcko decomposition to check if the molecule has a ring system that could correspond to a cyclic monosaccharide. But this might be too vague.

Alternatively, count the number of oxygen atoms. Monosaccharides typically have multiple hydroxyls and one ring oxygen (in cyclic forms) or a carbonyl oxygen. But this might not be reliable.

Perhaps the approach is:

1. Check for at least three carbons.
2. Check for at least three hydroxyl groups.
3. Check for either an aldehyde or ketone group, or a ring structure (indicative of cyclic form which can open to a carbonyl).
4. Ensure no glycosidic bonds (non-ring ether oxygens).

Let's try implementing this.

For the aldehyde/ketone check:

Aldehyde: a carbon connected to an oxygen via a double bond and at least one hydrogen. SMARTS: [CX3H1](=O)[#6] or [CH1](=O)

Ketone: [CX3](=O)[#6] where the carbon is connected to two other carbons.

But in cyclic forms, the carbonyl is not present. So perhaps we need to check for possible tautomers or rings that can open to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, consider that cyclic monosaccharides have a ring with one oxygen and multiple hydroxyls. For example, glucose has a 6-membered ring with five hydroxyls and one oxygen in the ring.

But how to programmatically check for that?

Alternatively, if there's no carbonyl group, check if there's a ring oxygen and that the molecule has enough hydroxyls. But this might not cover all cases.

Another approach: Use the formula. Monosaccharides have the formula (CH2O)n, where n ≥ 3. So check that the number of carbons equals the number of oxygens, and hydrogens are 2*C + 2 - O (approximate). But this might not work for deoxy sugars or derivatives.

Alternatively, check that the molecule has one carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) or a ring oxygen (for cyclic forms) along with multiple hydroxyls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is:

- Check for at least three carbons.
- Check for at least two hydroxyl groups (though examples have more).
- Check for either an aldehyde/ketone group or a ring oxygen (indicative of cyclic form).
- Ensure no non-ring ether oxygens (glycosidic bonds).

Let's try coding this.

First, parse the molecule.

Check for aldehyde: [CX3H1](=O)
Check for ketone: [CX3](=O)[#6]

If either is present, proceed.

If not, check for rings containing oxygen. If such a ring exists, it might be a cyclic form.

Then, count hydroxyl groups (O attached to C with single bond).

Also, check that all ether oxygens (O connected to two Cs) are in rings.

Additionally, ensure at least three carbons.

Putting this together:

Function is_monosaccharide(smiles):

- Parse the SMILES. If invalid, return False.
- Check number of carbons >=3.
- Find aldehyde or ketone groups. If none, check for rings with oxygen.
- Count hydroxyl groups (must be >=2).
- Check for any ether oxygens not in rings → if present, reject.
- Return True if all conditions met.

Let's code this.

Testing examples:

For D-glucose (cyclic), SMILES: OC[C@H]1O[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O

- Has a ring oxygen (in the ring), multiple hydroxyls. No aldehyde/ketone in cyclic form, but the code would check for the ring oxygen.

Another example: aldehydo-D-galactose (SMILES: [H]C(=O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO) has an aldehyde group.

Another example: beta-D-fructofuranose (cyclic ketose) would have a ring oxygen.

Deoxy sugars: like 2-deoxy-D-ribose still have a carbonyl group.

So, the code should handle these cases.

Potential issues:

- Molecules with both a carbonyl and ether linkages (unlikely in monosaccharides).
- Ring systems that are not monosaccharide-like.

But given the complexity, this approach might work.
