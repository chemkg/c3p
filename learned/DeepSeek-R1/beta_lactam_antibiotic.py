"""
Classifies: CHEBI:27933 beta-lactam antibiotic
"""
Testing this code with the example SMILES:

For example, benzylpenicillin (SMILES: N12C([C@H]([C@]1(SC([C@@H]2C(O)=O)(C)C)[H])NC(CC3=CC=CC=C3)=O)=O) should match the beta-lactam pattern. The code should return True.

However, the SMARTS pattern might not account for all variations. For instance, in some cases, the carbonyl might be part of a fused ring. But the SMARTS pattern should still match the four-membered ring portion.

Another possible issue: the SMARTS pattern might not account for different hybridization states or charges. For example, the nitrogen might be in a different valence state. Using [#7] (any nitrogen) should cover that.

In the code, after checking for the beta-lactam ring, it returns True. If that's the case, then the function should correctly identify the examples as beta-lactam antibiotics.

But wait, the problem states that the function should return a boolean and a reason. The previous code's error was a syntax error, which this code avoids by proper formatting.

Thus, this code should work. Let's check for possible errors. The SMARTS "[#7]1-C(=O)-[#6]-[#6]-1" should correctly identify the beta-lactam ring. If that's the case, then the function will return True for all the example SMILES provided, which contain a beta-lactam ring.

But wait, in the case of aztreonam, which is a monobactam (a single beta-lactam ring), the SMARTS should match. Let's look at its SMILES: C[C@H]1[C@H](NC(=O)C(=N/OC(C)(C)C(O)=O)\c2csc([NH3+])n2)C(=O)N1S([O-])(=O)=O. The beta-lactam ring here is N-C(=O)-C-C, forming a four-membered ring. So the SMARTS should match.

Another example: tazobactam's SMILES is C[C@]1(Cn2ccnn2)[C@@H](N2[C@@H](CC2=O)S1(=O)=O)C(O)=O. The beta-lactam ring is part of the structure. The SMARTS should find it.

Thus, the code should work. The previous error was due to invalid characters in the code (like the long dashes in the examples), which are now removed. The current code only includes the necessary parts.
