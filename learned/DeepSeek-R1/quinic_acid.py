Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The main issues were false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false negatives first: some valid quinic acid derivatives like methyl esters were missed because the code required a free carboxylic acid group (-COOH). But in esters like methyl 3,4-dicaffeoylquinate, the COOH is esterified (like COOCH3), so the SMARTS pattern [CX3](=O)[OX2H1] wouldn't match. The code needs to check for either a carboxylic acid or its ester.

For false positives, other cyclohexane carboxylic acids with enough oxygens were incorrectly classified. The original code counted all oxygens attached to the ring, including those from ester groups or other substituents. But quinic acid derivatives typically have multiple hydroxyl groups. Maybe we should check for at least three hydroxyl groups attached to the ring.

Another problem was how the code checked if the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring. The SMARTS [C;R]C(=O)O might not work if the ring is part of a bridged system. Using a substructure that matches the cyclohexane ring with a carboxylic acid directly attached could be better.

So, here's the plan:
1. Modify the carboxylic acid check to include esters (like COOR).
2. Ensure the carboxylic acid/ester is directly attached to the cyclohexane ring.
3. Require at least three hydroxyl groups on the ring (quinic acid has four, but derivatives might have some esterified).
4. Adjust the oxygen count to focus on hydroxyls (OH groups) rather than all oxygens.

Let me adjust the code accordingly. Check for the cyclohexane ring with a carboxylic acid (or ester) attached. Then verify hydroxyl groups and possibly other oxygen substituents. Also, handle ester cases where the COOH is modified.
