Okay, let's try to figure out how to create a function to detect anthoxanthins. From the problem statement, anthoxanthins are a type of flavonoid that are water-soluble and range from white to yellow. The examples given are mostly flavonoid glycosides, like kaempferol and quercetin derivatives with sugar groups attached.

First, I need to recall that flavonoids typically have a 15-carbon skeleton structure, consisting of two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by a three-carbon bridge (C). The presence of hydroxyl groups and glycosylation (sugar attachments) can influence solubility and color. Anthoxanthins are usually flavones or flavonols with hydroxyl groups and often O-glycosylation or C-glycosylation, which increases water solubility.

So the plan is:
1. Check if the molecule is a flavonoid. This involves finding the flavone/flavonol backbone. Flavones have a double bond between C2 and C3, and a ketone at C4. Flavonols have a hydroxyl group on C3.
2. Look for glycosylation (sugar attachments) which would increase solubility. These are often O-linked or C-linked sugars.
3. Check the hydroxylation pattern. Anthoxanthins might have multiple hydroxyl groups on the aromatic rings, contributing to their color and solubility.
4. Exclude anthocyanins, which are another class of flavonoids but are red/blue and typically have a different structure (anthocyanidins with a positive charge). But maybe that's not necessary here.

Possible steps in code:
- Use RDKit to parse the SMILES.
- Check for the flavone/flavonol core structure using SMARTS patterns.
- Detect glycosidic attachments (sugar groups) either via oxygen (O-glycosides) or carbon (C-glycosides).
- Count hydroxyl groups to ensure sufficient solubility.
- Check molecular weight to ensure it's not too large, but glycosides can be bigger. However, anthoxanthins are water-soluble, so maybe they have multiple polar groups.

Let me draft some SMARTS patterns. The flavone core could be something like:
c1c(=O)c2cc(O)ccc2oc1c3ccccc3

But maybe more general. Flavonoids have the benzopyran structure. For flavones, the C ring is a chromone (oxygen in the ring and a ketone). For flavonols, there's a hydroxyl on the C ring.

Another approach: look for the 2-phenylchromen-4-one structure. A SMARTS pattern for that might be:
c1c(=[O])c2c(oc1)ccc(c2)-c3ccccc3

But perhaps better to split into two aromatic rings connected via a ketone and oxygen.

Alternatively, using a more precise SMARTS for the flavone skeleton:
[O;R]=[C;R]([a;R])[a;R] 

Wait, maybe a better way is to find the chromone part (ring with oxygen and ketone) connected to a phenyl group.

For example, the chromone part is a benzene ring fused to a pyrone (which has a ketone). The SMARTS for chromone could be:
c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1

Then attached to another benzene ring (the B ring) via a single bond. So the full flavone pattern would be:
c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1-c3ccccc3

But maybe allowing substitutions. So in SMARTS, something like:
[#6]1:[#6](=[#8]):[#6]2:[#6](:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:2)-[#8]:1-[#6]3:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:3

But perhaps a more flexible approach. Let me check RDKit's SMARTS syntax.

Alternatively, using:
c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1-c3ccccc3

But allowing any substitution on the rings. Maybe the exact structure isn't necessary, but the presence of the flavone core.

Once the core is identified, check for glycosylation. Glycosides have a sugar moiety attached via an oxygen (O-glycoside) or directly to a carbon (C-glycoside). So looking for substructures where a hydroxyl oxygen is connected to a sugar (like glucose, rhamnose, etc.), which might be represented as a chain of multiple oxygen-containing groups.

But detecting all possible glycosides is tricky. Maybe look for any occurrence of a glycosidic bond, which is an oxygen connected to a carbon that's part of a sugar ring. Alternatively, check for the presence of a carbohydrate-like structure attached via O or C.

Alternatively, count the number of hydroxyl groups and sugar moieties. Anthoxanthins are often glycosylated, which adds hydroxyls from the sugar, increasing solubility.

Also, check the number of hydroxyl groups on the flavone core. For example, flavonols like quercetin have multiple hydroxyls.

So steps in code:
1. Check if the molecule has a flavone/flavonol core.
2. Check for the presence of sugar substituents (glycosylation).
3. Ensure sufficient hydroxylation for solubility.
4. Maybe exclude structures with certain features (like anthocyanidins, but perhaps not necessary here).

Potential issues:
- Some anthoxanthins might not be glycosylated (like simple flavones), but the examples provided are mostly glycosides. Need to check the class definition.
- The presence of methoxy groups might reduce solubility, but some examples have methoxy groups (like xanthomicrol has OCH3). However, the class description says they are water-soluble, so maybe methoxy groups are less common or compensated by glycosylation.

Possible code outline:
- Use SMARTS to find the flavone core.
- Check for glycosidic bonds (O- or C-linked sugars).
- Count hydroxyl groups and check molecular weight for solubility.

Testing with the example SMILES strings. For example, kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-allopyranoside has a flavone core (kaempferol) with a sugar attached. The code should detect the core and the glycoside.

So the function is_anthoxanthin would return
