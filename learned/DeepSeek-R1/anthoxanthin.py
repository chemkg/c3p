But wait, the previous code had an error: unterminated string literal. Let me check. Oh, in the docstring, maybe there was a missing triple quote. Let me make sure the code is properly formatted.

Another possible issue: the SMARTS patterns might not correctly identify the flavone core. For example, the flavone_pattern as written might be too strict. Let me adjust the SMARTS to be more flexible. The actual structure is two benzene rings connected via a pyrone (oxygen in the ring and a ketone). The SMARTS could be:

Flavone: c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1c3ccccc3 â†’ but this is very specific. Real structures might have substitutions. So perhaps a more general pattern that looks for the chromone part (the fused benzene and pyrone) connected to another aromatic ring.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that looks for the chromone (benzopyran-4-one) structure:

[c]1[c](=[O])[c]2[c][c][c][c][c]2[o][c]1-[c]3[c][c][c][c][c]3

But allowing any substitution. Maybe using:

[#6]1-,=:[#6](=[#8])-[#6]2:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:2-[#8]:1-[#6]3:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:3

But this might not capture all variations. Alternatively, split into two parts: the chromone (benzopyranone) and the phenyl group.

Another approach: find a benzene ring fused to a pyrone (O-containing ring with a ketone). The SMARTS for the chromone part could be:

c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1

Then check if this is connected to another aromatic ring (the B ring). But how to represent that connection?

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that allows any substitution on the chromone's C2 (the position where the B ring is attached).

But perhaps a better approach is to use two separate substructures: the chromone and the attached aromatic ring.

Alternatively, use a more generic pattern. For example, any structure with a ketone adjacent to an oxygen in a ring, connected to another aromatic ring.

But this might be too vague. Maybe the previous approach was too restrictive. Let's look at the example SMILES.

Take kaempferol: Oc1ccc(cc1)-c1oc2cc(O)cc(O)c2c(=O)c1O

The structure is two benzene rings connected via a pyrone (with the ketone). The SMILES is:

Oc1ccc(cc1)-c1oc2cc(O)cc(O)c2c(=O)c1O

So the core is c1oc2cc(O)cc(O)c2c(=O)c1 connected to another benzene ring.

So the SMARTS pattern for the core could be:

[#6]1:[#6](=[#8]):[#6]2:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:2-[#8]:1-[#6]3:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:3

But allowing for substitutions (like hydroxyl groups). So perhaps the SMARTS should be:

c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1-c3ccccc3

But with wildcards for substituents. Wait, in the example, the B ring is attached to the pyrone's C2. So the SMARTS pattern would be:

c1c(=O)c2ccccc2oc1-c3ccccc3

But this exact structure might not match if there are substituents. So maybe using a more flexible pattern that allows any substitution on the benzene rings.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that finds the pyrone ring (with the ketone) connected to any aromatic ring. For example:

[#6]1(-[#6]):[#6](=[#8]):[#6]2:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:2-[#8]:1-[#6]3:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:3

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that finds a ketone adjacent to an oxygen in a ring, connected to another aromatic ring.

Alternatively, use the following approach: check for the presence of a flavone-like core by looking for the 2-phenylchromen-4-one structure, allowing for substitutions.

Another possible issue in the previous code: the glycosylation check. The SMARTS patterns for glycosidic bonds might not be sufficient. For example, the glycoside_o_pattern was [O;!H0]-[C;!$(C=O)], which matches an oxygen with a hydrogen (like -O-) attached to a carbon that's not a carbonyl. But this could match any ether, not just glycosides. Similarly, the sugar_pattern [C;H1][OH] is too vague.

To detect glycosylation, perhaps look for a carbohydrate moiety. But detecting all possible sugars is complex. A heuristic could be to check for a chain of at least 4 contiguous carbons with multiple hydroxyl groups. But that's error-prone.

Alternatively, use the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a certain number of oxygen atoms. But glycosides have multiple oxygens from the sugar.

Alternatively, use the number of oxygen atoms. For example, if the molecule has more than a certain number of oxygens, it might indicate glycosylation. But this is not reliable.

Another approach: check for the presence of a glycosidic bond (O-linkage to a sugar). The SMARTS for an O-glycoside could be [O;R]-[C;R], where the oxygen is part of a ring (the sugar) connected to another carbon. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use RDKit's functionality to identify carbohydrate structures. However, RDKit doesn't have built-in carbohydrate detection, so this would require custom code.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to check for the presence of at least one glycosidic oxygen (O connected to a carbon that's part of a ring with multiple oxygens). For example:

glycoside_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[O]-C1C(O)C(O)C(O)CO1")  # example for glucose

But this is specific to certain sugars. Alternatively, look for any oxygen connected to a carbon in a ring that has at least two other oxygen atoms.

But this might not cover all cases. For example, rhamnose is a sugar with a methyl group and oxygen in the ring.

Alternatively, look for any six-membered or five-membered ring containing at least two oxygen atoms, connected via an oxygen. But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps, given the examples, the presence of a glycosidic bond (O-linked) is common. So the code can check for O-linked substituents. But how?

Alternatively, check if there's an oxygen atom that is connected to a carbon which is part of a ring and has multiple hydroxyl groups. For example:

glyco_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[O]-[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)O1")  # glucose

But this is specific to a certain sugar configuration. Since the examples have various sugars (glucose, rhamnose, etc.), this approach might miss some.

Given the difficulty, perhaps the code should check for the presence of any sugar-like rings (like pyranose or furanose rings) attached via an oxygen. But without a comprehensive SMARTS pattern, this is challenging.

Alternatively, accept that detecting glycosylation accurately is difficult and use a heuristic: check if there's at least one oxygen connected to a carbon that's part of a ring with at least two oxygen atoms. This would capture most sugars.

The SMARTS pattern for that could be:

[O]-[C]1-[C](-[O])-[C](-[O])-[C](-[O])-[C]-1

But this is a rough approximation. Alternatively:

[O]-C1-C(-O)-C(-O)-C(-O)-C-O1 (for a pyranose ring with multiple hydroxyls)

But this is too specific. Instead, use a more general pattern that looks for a ring with at least two oxygen atoms and an adjacent oxygen.

Maybe:

[O]-[C]@;=,-[C]@;=,-[O]

Not sure. Alternatively, use a ring with at least two oxygen atoms, and an exocyclic oxygen attached to the ring.

Alternatively, use the following SMARTS for a sugar ring:

[O]-C1-C(-O)-C(-O)-C(-O)-C-O1

But again, this is too specific. For example, rhamnose has a methyl group and fewer hydroxyls.

Another idea: count the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule. Anthoxanthins, especially glycosides, have a high number of oxygens. For example, kaempferol (C15H10O6) has 6 oxygens. Its glycosides would have more. So maybe require at least 6 oxygens.

But some examples might have fewer. For instance, 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone has OCH3 groups. Let's see: C18H16O5 (if three methoxys and the flavone core). So oxygen count is 5. But according to the examples, the SMILES for 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone is COc1cc2oc(cc(=O)c2c(OC)c1OC)-c1ccccc1. That's three methoxys (3 O's), the ketone (1 O), and the ether oxygens in the rings (two O's). Total O's: 3*2 (from OCH3) + 1 (ketone) + 2 (ring oxygens) = 3*1 (since OCH3 has one O each) + 1 + 2 = 3 +1 +2=6. So O count is 6. So maybe requiring at least 5 oxygens.

But this is just a heuristic. The code can check for oxygen count.

Alternatively, combine multiple checks: flavone core, presence of glycosylation (even if heuristic), and sufficient hydroxyl groups.

Putting it all together, here's the revised code:
