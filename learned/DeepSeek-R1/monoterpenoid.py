</think>

Okay, I need to create a function called is_monoterpenoid that determines if a given SMILES string represents a monoterpenoid. Let's start by understanding what a monoterpenoid is. The definition says it's derived from a monoterpene, which has a C10 skeleton. But the skeleton can be rearranged or modified, possibly by removing methyl groups. So the key points are:

1. **Origin**: Derived from a monoterpene (C10 base structure).
2. **Modifications**: The C10 skeleton might be rearranged or have some methyl groups removed.
3. **Examples**: The provided examples include various bicyclic structures, oxygen-containing groups (like alcohols, ketones), and sometimes branched chains.

First, I need to check if the molecule has 10 carbon atoms. But wait, the definition allows for modifications where some carbons (like methyl groups) might be removed. So maybe the original monoterpene has 10 carbons, but the derived monoterpenoid could have fewer? For example, if a methyl group is removed, that would reduce the count. So maybe the carbon count should be around 10, but perhaps a bit less. However, some examples like (+)-pulegone (C10H16O) have 10 carbons. Let me check some examples:

- The first example, (2S,4R)-p-Mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol: SMILES OC1CC(CCC1=C)C(C)=C. Let's count the carbons: the main ring has 6 (from the cyclohexane-like structure), plus the 2 branches (C(C)=C) adds 3 more (since C(C)=C is two carbons attached to another). Wait, maybe I should parse it properly. Alternatively, perhaps using RDKit to count the carbons would be more accurate.

But perhaps a better approach is to look for the terpene backbone. Monoterpenes are made of two isoprene units. Isoprene is C5H8, so two units would be C10H16, but with various cyclizations and functional groups.

However, detecting isoprene units programmatically might be tricky. An alternative approach could be:

1. **Check the number of carbons**: Original monoterpene is C10, but modifications might remove some. So maybe between 8-10 carbons? Need to check examples.

Looking at the examples:

- (+)-pulegone: SMILES C[C@@H]1CCC(C(=O)C1)=C(C)C. Carbons: Let's count. The main ring (cyclohexane derivative) has 6 carbons. Then the substituents: a methyl group (C), a carbonyl (O doesn't count), another C(=O), and a C(C)C branch. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's parse the SMILES:

The structure is a bicyclic system. The main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone and a methyl group. Total carbons: 10? Let me count:

- The cyclohexane ring (6 carbons)
- The ketone (O, no carbon)
- The substituents: two methyl groups (C and C(C)C). Wait, maybe the total is 10? Or perhaps 9? Maybe I should rely on RDKit to compute the exact count.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbon count isn't the most reliable. Another approach is to look for the presence of terpene-like structures, such as bicyclic systems, or specific patterns.

Another idea: Monoterpenoids are often bicyclic (like pinene, which is a bicyclic monoterpene). But some are monocyclic or acyclic. So detecting bicyclic systems might help, but isn't sufficient.

Alternatively, using the molecular formula. Monoterpenes typically have the formula C10H16, but with functional groups (like alcohols, ketones), the formula changes. For example, adding an OH would make it C10H18O. But if a methyl group is removed, it might be C9H14O.

But how to account for this variability? Maybe checking the number of carbons is between 8 and 10. Let's see some examples:

- The example "6-hydroxycamphor" has SMILES CC1(C)C2CC(O)C1(C)C(=O)C2. Camphor is C10H16O. Hydroxycamphor would be C10H16O2. So 10 carbons.

Another example: "neryl acetate" SMILES C(=C\COC(C)=O)(\CCC=C(C)C)/C. Let's parse: the main chain has a geranyl or neryl group (C10), esterified with acetate. Wait, neryl is a monoterpene alcohol (C10H18O), and acetate would add 2 carbons (from the acetyl group), making it C12? Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Wait, neryl acetate is the ester of nerol (a monoterpene alcohol) and acetic acid. So nerol is C10H18O, acetate would be C10H17OAc → C12H20O2. But the example given here might have a different structure. Wait, the SMILES given is C(=C\COC(C)=O)(\CCC=C(C)C)/C. Let's count the carbons:

- The left side: C(=C\COC(C)=O) → that's a chain with a carbonyl group attached to a methyl (C=O from acetate). The main chain: perhaps the neryl part. Let's see:

The SMILES structure: The central part is C(=C...) which is a double bond. The left side has COC(C)=O (acetate group: O-C-O connected to a carbonyl). The right side has CCC=C(C)C. So total carbons: Let's count each part.

- The acetate group: O-C(=O)-C (3 carbons, but the O is from the ester). The main chain: the part after the ester. The right side CCC=C(C)C is 5 carbons (since CCC=C(C) is four carbons in the chain, plus the methyl branch). The left side C(=C\COC...) has a chain: the C= is part of the main chain. Maybe the total is 10? Not sure. This could be a problem because if the molecule has more than 10 carbons, the carbon count check would fail.

This suggests that relying solely on carbon count might not work. So perhaps a better approach is to check for the presence of terpene-derived structures, like specific rings or branching patterns.

Another approach: Monoterpenoids are derived from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) or neryl pyrophosphate (NPP), which are C10 units. The skeleton can be linear, monocyclic, or bicyclic. So perhaps the presence of a bicyclic structure with certain features could indicate a monoterpenoid.

But how to detect that in RDKit? Maybe using SMARTS patterns to identify common monoterpenoid skeletons, like pinane, bornane, menthane, etc.

For example, bornane is a bicyclic structure with two fused cyclohexane rings. A SMARTS pattern for bornane could be useful. However, creating SMARTS patterns for all possible monoterpenoid skeletons is impractical.

Alternative idea: Use the presence of two isoprene units. Isoprene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)=CH2. Two isoprene units can be linked head-to-tail, etc. But detecting this arrangement in a modified structure (with rings, functional groups) is challenging.

Another angle: The molecular weight. Monoterpenes are around 136 g/mol (C10H16). With functional groups, maybe up to 200-250. But some examples might have higher MW if they have multiple oxygen atoms or other substituents.

But again, this is not reliable. For example, neryl acetate would have a higher MW.

Alternatively, check the number of isoprene units. Monoterpenoids have two isoprene units. RDKit has a function to calculate the number of isoprene units? Not directly, but perhaps using the Murcko decomposition to get the scaffold and check.

Alternatively, the program could check for the presence of a terpene-like structure by looking for branching patterns, but this is vague.

Wait, the previous attempt had an error: "Error: unexpected indent (<string>, line 1)". That suggests that the code had incorrect indentation. So maybe the code was not properly formatted. The user's previous code might have had syntax errors, leading to no test cases passing. So the first step is to ensure the code is syntactically correct.

But the user's previous code wasn't shown; the error was from their last attempt. So in the current attempt, the code must be properly indented.

Now, focusing on the function:

The function is_monoterpenoid should:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. Check if it's a valid molecule.
3. Determine if it's a monoterpenoid.

Possible steps:

- Check the number of carbons is between 8-10 (allowing for removal of methyl groups).
- Check for the presence of terpene-like structures (e.g., bicyclic systems, specific rings).
- Check for oxygen-containing groups (since many monoterpenoids have functional groups like alcohols, ketones).

But how to implement this?

First, count the carbons:

def is_monoterpenoid(smiles):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if not mol:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES"
    c_count = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6)
    # Monoterpenoids are derived from C10, but may have lost some carbons
    if c_count < 8 or c_count > 10:
        return False, f"Carbon count {c_count} outside 8-10 range"
    # Additional checks...

But wait, some examples might have more carbons. For example, neryl acetate has 12 carbons (neryl is C10, acetate adds 2). But the example given for neryl acetate is SMILES: C(=C\COC(C)=O)(\CCC=C(C)C)/C. Let's count the carbons here:

- The main chain: the part after the ester. The right side is CCC=C(C)C: that's 5 carbons (the chain is C-C-C-C=C(C)-C?), maybe 5. The left side is C(=C)-COC(C)=O: the acetate group is O-C(=O)-C, which is 2 carbons (the acetyl group). The main chain may have more. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the carbon count approach isn't reliable.

Alternatively, perhaps the original monoterpene skeleton has 10 carbons, but substituents (like acetate) add more. So the carbon count could be higher. For example, neryl acetate is a monoterpenoid but has 12 carbons. So the previous approach of checking 8-10 carbons would fail here. Therefore, the carbon count check is not sufficient.

This complicates things. So perhaps the carbon count check should be removed, or adjusted to a higher range. But how?

Alternative plan:

1. Check if the molecule is a terpenoid. Terpenoids are derived from terpenes, which are made of isoprene units. Monoterpenoids have two isoprene units.

But detecting isoprene units in a modified structure is difficult. RDKit doesn't have a built-in function for this. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Another idea: Use the Biogenic template from RDKit. The RDKit has a function to check if a molecule matches biogenic compound templates. However, I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, use the number of rings plus the number of carbons. Monoterpenoids often have one or two rings (like menthol, pinene, etc.). But this is not always the case.

Alternatively, look for specific substructures common in monoterpenoids. For example, the menthane skeleton (common in menthol), pinane (in pinene), etc.

But creating SMARTS patterns for all possible monoterpenoid skeletons is impractical. However, perhaps checking for bicyclic systems with specific ring sizes could help.

For example, pinane is a bicyclic system with a fused cyclopropane and cyclohexane. A SMARTS pattern for such a system might be complex.

Alternatively, check for the presence of a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system (norbornane), which is present in some monoterpenoids.

Looking at the examples:

- The example "Santene hydrate" has SMILES OC1(C2CC(C1C)CC2)C. This seems to have a bicyclo structure.

But creating a general SMARTS pattern for all possible monoterpenoid skeletons is challenging.

Alternative approach: Use the presence of at least one ring and check the molecular formula for being in the range of monoterpenoids (C10HxOy...). But again, substituents can vary.

Alternatively, check if the molecule has a terpene-like skeleton by using the Murcko decomposition to get the scaffold and then checking if it's a known monoterpene scaffold.

But implementing this would require a database of monoterpene scaffolds, which isn't feasible here.

Another angle: Monoterpenoids are often found in essential oils and have characteristic odors. But that's not useful programmatically.

Perhaps the best approach is to combine several checks:

1. Check that the molecule has 10 carbons (allowing for some variation if methyl groups are removed, but perhaps 8-12?).
2. Check for the presence of oxygen atoms (since many monoterpenoids are oxidized).
3. Check for specific substructures like bicyclic systems or isoprene-derived branches.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, parse the molecule and check validity.

Then, count carbons. If the count is between 8-12 (allowing for some modification), proceed.

Check for oxygen atoms (maybe optional, as some monoterpenoids might not have oxygen).

Check for bicyclic systems. To detect bicyclic systems, we can compute the ring info and see if there are at least two rings, and they share a common bridge.

Alternatively, use RDKit's ring detection. For example, if the molecule has two rings and they are fused, it might be bicyclic.

But how to detect bicyclic systems programmatically?

Another idea: Calculate the number of rings and the number of bridgeheads. Bicyclic systems have bridgehead atoms. RDKit's rdMolDescriptors.CalcNumBridgeheadAtoms could be useful.

So, if the number of bridgehead atoms is at least two, it's likely a bicyclic system.

Alternatively, use the formula for the number of rings. The number of rings in a bicyclic compound is two, but they are connected in a way that forms a bridge.

But this might not cover all cases.

Putting it all together:

def is_monoterpenoid(smiles):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if not mol:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES"
    c_count = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6)
    # Adjusted carbon count to 8-12 to accommodate modifications
    if not (8 <= c_count <= 12):
        return False, f"Carbon count {c_count} not in 8-12 range"
    # Check for oxygen atoms (common but not mandatory)
    o_count = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 8)
    # Check for bicyclic structure using bridgehead atoms
    bridgeheads = rdMolDescriptors.CalcNumBridgeheadAtoms(mol)
    if bridgeheads >= 2:
        return True, "Bicyclic structure with bridgehead atoms"
    # Alternatively, check for specific substructures like isoprene units
    # Check for isoprene-like patterns (head-to-tail)
    # This is a simplified isoprene unit (C-C(=C)-C-C)
    isoprene_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("C-C(=C)-C-C")
    matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(isoprene_pattern)
    if len(matches) >= 2:
        return True, "Contains two isoprene units"
    # Additional checks for common monoterpenoid skeletons
    # Example: menthane skeleton (not sure of SMARTS)
    # If none of the above, return False
    return False, "Does not match monoterpenoid criteria"

But this is speculative. The isoprene pattern might not capture all cases, especially in cyclic structures. The bridgehead check might miss some bicyclic systems.

Testing this approach with the examples:

For (+)-pulegone (C10H16O), the carbon count is 10, which is within 8-12. The bridgehead check: pulegone has a bicyclic structure? Let me visualize. Pulegone is a cyclic monoterpene ketone. Its structure is a substituted cyclohexanone. Maybe it's monocyclic, not bicyclic. So the bridgehead check would fail. The isoprene pattern might find two isoprene units, but in a cyclic structure, the pattern may not match.

This approach might not work for all cases.

Alternative idea: Use the molecular formula to check if it's consistent with a monoterpene derivative. Monoterpenes have the formula C10H16, and derivatives would have added oxygen, etc. But this is too vague.

Perhaps the best approach is to check for the presence of a terpene skeleton by looking for two isoprene units. But how?

An isoprene unit is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2. But in cyclic structures, the double bonds may be in different positions. Creating a SMARTS pattern that matches any isoprene-like unit (with possible branching) is challenging.

Alternatively, look for branching patterns typical of terpenes. For example, a carbon with two methyl branches (like the head of an isoprene unit).

A SMARTS pattern for a carbon connected to two methyl groups: [CH2](C)(C)*. But this might not be specific enough.

Another approach: Use the number of methyl groups. Monoterpenes often have multiple methyl branches. But this is not a definitive check.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to check for the presence of a bicyclic structure and a carbon count in the 8-12 range, along with some oxygen atoms (though optional).

Alternatively, use the original definition: derived from a monoterpene (C10), allowing for rearrangement or removal of methyl groups. So the core is a C10 skeleton, possibly modified. But detecting that programmatically is difficult.

In conclusion, the previous code likely failed due to syntax errors (indentation), so ensuring proper code structure is crucial. Then, implementing checks for carbon count, bicyclic systems, and possibly isoprene units could help. However, this approach might not cover all cases but could work for many examples.
