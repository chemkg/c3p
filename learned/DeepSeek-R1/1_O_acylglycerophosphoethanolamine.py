Okay, let's figure out why the previous code failed. The error message says that 'rdMolDescriptors' doesn't have 'CalcNumAdjacentHeavyAtoms'. Oh right, I remember that RDKit doesn't have that specific function. The previous code tried to use it to calculate the chain length, which isn't valid. That's definitely the main issue here.

So, I need to replace that part. How else can I check the acyl chain length? Maybe traverse the chain manually. Let's think: starting from the carbonyl carbon (C=O), follow the connected carbons to count the chain length.

Also, looking at the examples, the acyl chains can vary in length and have double bonds. The chain should be a long hydrocarbon attached via an ester at position 1 of the glycerol.

Another thing: the core_pattern might not be matching correctly. The glycerol backbone should have the phosphoethanolamine at position 3. Maybe the SMARTS pattern for the core isn't accurate. Let's adjust that to better capture the glycerol connected to phosphate and ethanolamine.

The ester_pattern checks for [CH2][OX2][C](=O), which might not capture the exact position. Maybe the ester is on the first carbon of glycerol, so the structure should be O-C(=O) attached to a CH2 group that's part of the glycerol.

Also, checking for exactly one ester group is important because it's a 1-O-acyl, so no other esters should be present.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Check for the phosphoethanolamine group (O-P-O-ethanolamine).
2. Find the glycerol backbone connected to the phosphate group.
3. Ensure there's exactly one ester group (O-C=O) attached to the first carbon of glycerol.
4. Verify the acyl chain length from the ester is sufficiently long.
5. Ensure no other ester groups are present.

For the acyl chain length, after finding the carbonyl group (C=O), the adjacent carbon is part of the chain. We can traverse that chain and count the carbons.

Let me adjust the code accordingly:

- Replace CalcNumAdjacentHeavyAtoms with a loop that follows the chain.
- Fix the SMARTS patterns for core and ester groups.
- Ensure the chain length is counted correctly, starting from the carbonyl.

Also, in the previous code, the core_pattern might not account for stereochemistry or different arrangements. Maybe using a more flexible SMARTS for the glycerol-phosphate part.

Testing with the example SMILES should help. For instance, in "P(OC[C@H](O)COC(=O)...", the glycerol has three carbons, with the phosphate on the third, and the ester on the first.

So, let's rewrite the code with these fixes.
