Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was really low, so there were a lot of false positives and false negatives. Let's look at the examples provided.

First, the false positives. The model incorrectly classified some compounds as alkaloids. For example, Melithiazol K has a heterocyclic nitrogen but might be an antibiotic, which are excluded. The code's current exclusion for antibiotics isn't handling that. Also, some compounds like prontosil (an azo compound) were wrongly classified. The code probably didn't check for azo groups.

Then, the false negatives. Cathinone was missed because it's a low molecular weight amine. The previous code excluded amines with MW <250, but maybe cathinone's MW is just under that. The code's threshold might be too strict. Also, some compounds with amide bonds (like holomycin) were excluded, but maybe the amide check is too aggressive. The problem says that alkaloids can have neutral compounds related to basic ones, so some amides might still be alkaloids.

Another issue: the heterocyclic check. The code checks if any nitrogen is in a ring, but maybe some valid alkaloids have nitrogen not in a ring but are biogenetically related. The current code might miss those. Also, the exclusion of pyrimidine/purine is too simplistic. Nucleotides have those, but some alkaloids might have similar rings if they're not part of a nucleotide structure.

The code also checks for complex ring systems with nitrogen, but maybe that's too vague. Some false positives were flagged as complex systems when they shouldn't be.

Let me think about improvements:

1. **Amide Bonds**: The problem states that some neutral compounds related to alkaloids are included. So maybe not all amides should be excluded. The previous code excluded any molecule with amide bonds (CalcNumAmideBonds >0). But some alkaloids might have amide groups. For example, holomycin has a thioamide but is considered an alkaloid in the examples. The current code excludes it because of amide bonds. So the amide check is causing false negatives. Need to adjust that.

2. **Amino Acid Check**: The current pattern for amino acids is [NH2]-[CX4]-C(=O)[OH], which is the standard structure. But maybe some derivatives are slipping through. However, the false negatives here don't seem related to amino acids.

3. **Exocyclic Amines**: The code checks for exocyclic amines with MW <250. Cathinone (MW 149.2) is excluded because of this. But cathinone is a valid alkaloid. So the MW threshold is too low. Maybe increase it or find another way to exclude simple amines.

4. **Heterocyclic Check**: The code requires heterocyclic nitrogen unless it's a complex ring system. But some valid alkaloids might have nitrogen not in a ring but are part of a complex structure. The example of cathinone has an exocyclic amine but is an alkaloid. Wait, but according the problem definition, exocyclic amines are usually not considered. But cathinone is listed as an example. Hmm, this is conflicting. The problem statement says compounds with exocyclic amines are usually amines, but the example includes cathinone, which has an exocyclic amine (the NH2 is on a carbon adjacent to the ketone). So maybe the definition here has exceptions, or cathinone is considered an alkaloid despite the exocyclic N. This suggests that the code's approach to exocyclic amines is too strict.

5. **Nucleotide Check**: The code checks for phosphate and ribose, but maybe some non-nucleotide compounds have these groups. The current check might not be sufficient.

6. **Azo Compounds**: The false positives include prontosil, which has an azo group (N=N). The code doesn't check for azo groups, which are not typical in alkaloids.

7. **Other Exclusions**: The code should exclude amino sugars, antibiotics, etc., but those checks might be missing.

So, to improve:

- Remove or adjust the amide bond exclusion. Maybe only exclude if there are multiple amide bonds (like peptides) but allow single amides. Or check if the amide is part of a peptide chain.

- Adjust the exocyclic amine check. Maybe allow certain exocyclic amines if they are part of a larger heterocyclic system or have higher MW.

- Increase the MW threshold for exocyclic amines. Maybe 150 is too low; cathinone's MW is around 149, so increasing to 200 might help.

- Add checks for azo groups (N=N) and exclude them.

- Refine the heterocyclic check. Maybe require at least one nitrogen in a ring unless the structure is complex.

- Improve the nucleotide check. Maybe look for both phosphate and sugar moieties in proximity.

- Add a check for nitro groups (O=[N+]=O), which are not typical in alkaloids.

Let's try modifying the code with these adjustments. For example:

- Remove the amide bond check or only exclude if multiple amide bonds are present.

- Add a check for azo groups.

- Adjust the MW threshold for exocyclic amines to 200.

- Check for nitro groups and exclude.

- Ensure that pyrimidine/purine are only excluded if part of a nucleotide-like structure.

But implementing all these might be complex. Let's proceed step by step in the code.
