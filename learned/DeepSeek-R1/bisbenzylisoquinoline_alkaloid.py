Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work. The main issue was that all the test cases were failing because the code couldn't find any isoquinoline units. The error messages said "Found 0 isoquinoline units, need at least 2". So the problem must be with how the isoquinoline pattern was defined.

Looking at the previous code, the isoquinoline pattern was set as "c1ccc2cnccc2c1". That's supposed to represent a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. But maybe the SMARTS pattern isn't correct. Let me check the SMARTS for isoquinoline. Isoquinoline has a benzene ring fused to a pyridine where the nitrogen is in position 2. The correct SMARTS should be "c1c2c[nH]ccc2ccc1" or something similar. Wait, maybe the original pattern didn't account for the correct ring fusion or aromaticity.

Another possibility is that in the actual molecules, the isoquinoline units might be substituted with various groups (like methoxy), so the basic pattern might not match if the code is looking for unsubstituted rings. The original SMARTS uses lowercase 'c' which is for aromatic carbons, but maybe the actual structures have substitutions that break the aromaticity in certain positions, or the rings are part of larger systems.

Also, the code checks for tertiary amines, but some examples might have different nitrogen environments. For instance, if the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring (like in isoquinoline), it's not a tertiary amine. Wait, in isoquinoline, the nitrogen is in a pyridine-like
