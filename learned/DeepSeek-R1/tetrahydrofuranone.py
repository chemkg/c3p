</think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to create a function called is_tetrahydrofuranone that checks if a given SMILES string is a tetrahydrofuranone. From the definition, a tetrahydrofuranone is an oxolane (which is another name for tetrahydrofuran) with an oxo group (a ketone) substituent on the ring. 

First, I need to recall the structure of tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one oxygen. The "oxolane" part refers to the saturated five-membered ring with one oxygen. The "oxo" substituent means there's a ketone group (=O) attached to the ring.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. **Check if the molecule has a tetrahydrofuran (oxolane) ring.** That means a five-membered ring with four carbons and one oxygen, fully saturated (no double bonds in the ring). 
2. **Check if there's a ketone group (=O) attached to the ring.** The oxo group should be directly part of the ring or as a substituent.

Wait, but the definition says "any oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring." So the oxo group must be part of the ring structure. Wait, no—if it's a substituent, then it's a substituent on the ring. Wait, but in the examples given, like gamma-valerolactone (SMILES: CC1CCC(=O)O1), the structure is a five-membered ring where one of the carbons is a carbonyl. So the oxo is part of the ring. Wait, but gamma-valerolactone is a cyclic ester (lactone), which has a carbonyl in the ring. So in that case, the ring has an oxygen and a carbonyl. Wait, but lactones are cyclic esters, so the carbonyl is part of the ester group. So maybe the oxo group is part of the ring structure. 

Wait, the definition says "oxolane having an oxo substituent". Oxolane is the fully saturated five-membered ring (O in one position, four CH2 groups). An oxo substituent would be a =O group attached to one of the ring carbons. So maybe the ring is oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) with a ketone group attached as a substituent. But looking at the examples, like gamma-valerolactone (SMILES CC1CCC(=O)O1), the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C=O, but wait, that's a five-membered ring where one of the carbons is a carbonyl. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C=O, but that would make it a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl. Wait, but that's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester, so the carbonyl is part of the ester. So in that case, the ring includes the carbonyl oxygen. But in that structure, the ring has two oxygen atoms? No, the lactone would have the ester oxygen as part of the ring. Wait, no. Let me look at gamma-valerolactone's structure. Gamma-valerolactone is a cyclic ester where the ester group is part of the ring. The structure is a five-membered ring: O connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and three CH2 groups. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C(=O)-, forming a five-membered ring. So in this case, the ring has an oxygen and a carbonyl group. But oxolane is the fully saturated ring without any double bonds. So perhaps the definition here is that the oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) ring has a ketone substituent. But in the case of gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring. Hmm, maybe the definition is broader, allowing the oxo group to be part of the ring or as a substituent. Wait, the examples given include structures where the carbonyl is part of the ring (like lactones) and others where it's a substituent. For example, 5,5-dimethyl-3-(1-thiocyanatoethyl)dihydro-2(3H)-furanone (SMILES: CC(SC#N)C1CC(C)(C)OC1=O) has the carbonyl as part of the ring. Wait, looking at that SMILES: OC1=O. Wait, no. The SMILES is CC(SC#N)C1CC(C)(C)OC1=O. The ring is O-C1-... connected to =O. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C with the =O attached to the oxygen? Wait, maybe the structure is a five-membered ring where one of the carbons is a carbonyl. Let me parse the SMILES: OC1=O. Wait, the SMILES for that example is CC(SC#N)C1CC(C)(C)OC1=O. So the ring is formed by O connected to C1, then C1 is connected to other carbons, and the O is part of the ring. Then the =O is attached to the ring oxygen? Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the SMILES is written as O-C1-... and the =O is a substituent. Wait, perhaps the ring is four-membered? Let me draw it out. The SMILES is CC(SC#N)C1CC(C)(C)OC1=O. The ring is formed by the O and the C1. So the ring is O-C1-C-C-C, and then the C1 is connected to the rest. Wait, maybe the ring is five-membered. Let me see: The part after the first C is (SC#N), then C1 is connected to CC(C)(C), then O connected to C1, and then C1 is double-bonded to O. Wait, no. The SMILES notation: OC1=O would mean that the O is single-bonded to C1, which is double-bonded to O. But that's a carbonyl group. So the ring would have an oxygen atom connected to a carbonyl. For example, in the SMILES OC1=O..., the ring would be O-C1(=O)-... So in that case, the ring includes a carbonyl group. But oxolane is the saturated version. So perhaps the definition here includes both the saturated ring with a substituent oxo group and the ring that includes a carbonyl as part of the ring (like a lactone). But according to the problem statement, the class is defined as any oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) with an oxo substituent. So maybe the oxo group is a substituent on the tetrahydrofuran ring, not part of the ring itself. But in the example of gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the IUPAC definition. 

Wait, the problem statement says: 'Any oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring.' So oxolane is the parent structure (tetrahydrofuran), and the oxo group is a substituent. That would imply that the oxo is a substituent, not part of the ring. But in the examples given, like gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring. So perhaps the definition here is broader, including both cases. Alternatively, maybe the term 'oxolane' in this context allows for the presence of the oxo group as part of the ring. Wait, but oxolane is the fully saturated ring. If the ring has a carbonyl, then it's not fully saturated. So perhaps the correct approach is to look for a five-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (the oxolane) and at least one carbonyl group (oxo) either as part of the ring or as a substituent. Wait, but that may not fit the definition. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

The definition says: 'Any oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring.' So the parent is oxolane (tetrahydrofuran), which is a saturated five-membered ring with one oxygen. The substituent is an oxo group (a =O) attached to any position on the ring. So the oxo is a substituent, not part of the ring. But in lactones, the carbonyl is part of the ring. So perhaps the examples include both scenarios where the oxo is a substituent and where it's part of the ring. That suggests that the definition might be including both possibilities, but according to the problem statement's definition, it's only substituents. This is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the term 'oxolane' here is used more broadly. Let me check the ChEBI definition for tetrahydrofuranone. Wait, the user provided the examples, but the actual ChEBI definition might differ. However, the user's definition is the one to follow. 

So, according to the user's definition, the molecule must be an oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) with an oxo substituent. So the oxo is a substituent on the ring. But in the example gamma-valerolactone (SMILES CC1CCC(=O)O1), the structure is a five-membered ring with O and a carbonyl. Wait, the SMILES is CC1CCC(=O)O1. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C(=O)-, forming a five-membered ring. That would mean the ring has one oxygen and one carbonyl. But oxolane is the saturated ring. So perhaps in this case, the carbonyl is part of the ring, making it a cyclic ketone, which would be a tetrahydrofuranone. So maybe the definition allows the oxo group to be part of the ring, i.e., the ring has a ketone group. 

This is a bit confusing. To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a five-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and at least one carbonyl group (either as part of the ring or as a substituent). But according to the problem's definition, the oxo is a substituent. So perhaps the correct way is to find a five-membered saturated ring (oxolane) with a carbonyl group attached as a substituent. 

Alternatively, maybe the oxo can be part of the ring. For example, if the ring has a carbonyl, making it a cyclic ketone. In that case, the ring would have four carbons, one oxygen, and one carbonyl (as part of the ring). But that would make the ring have a double bond, so it's not fully saturated. Wait, but oxolane is fully saturated. So if the ring has a carbonyl, it's not an oxolane anymore. Therefore, the oxo must be a substituent. 

Wait, this is conflicting. Let's think of the structure. Oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one O. If there's an oxo substituent, that would be a ketone group attached to one of the carbons in the ring. So the ring remains saturated, and the substituent is a =O on one of the carbons. 

But in the example gamma-valerolactone, the structure is a cyclic ester, which includes a carbonyl as part of the ring. So in that case, the ring is not fully saturated (since the carbonyl is a double bond). Therefore, according to the original definition, gamma-valerolactone would not qualify as an oxolane with an oxo substituent, because the ring is not fully saturated. But the user included it as an example. So there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that the problem's definition might be using "oxolane" in a broader sense, allowing for rings that have a carbonyl group as part of the ring. In that case, the approach would be to identify a five-membered ring containing one oxygen and one carbonyl group (as part of the ring), making it a cyclic ketone. 

Alternatively, perhaps the definition considers the oxo group as part of the ring, which would mean that the ring is not fully saturated (has a double bond), but the parent is still considered oxolane. That might not be chemically accurate, but given the examples, this must be the case. 

So, to handle the examples provided, the approach should be:

1. Identify a five-membered ring that includes one oxygen atom.
2. Ensure that within the ring, there is a carbonyl group (C=O) either as part of the ring structure or as a substituent.

But how to distinguish between substituents and part of the ring? 

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule that is part of a five-membered ring containing one oxygen. 

Wait, looking at the example gamma-valerolactone (SMILES CC1CCC(=O)O1), the ring is O-C-C-C-C(=O), which is a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl. So the ring has five members: O, C, C, C, C=O. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C(=O)-, connected back to O? No, the SMILES is CC1CCC(=O)O1. Breaking it down: 

- The '1' is a ring closure. So the structure is:

C connected to C connected to C1. Then C1 is connected to C, C, C, and O1. The O1 is connected to the C with a double bond O. Wait, no. The SMILES is CCC(=O)O1. Wait, perhaps the ring is formed by the O1 and the C1. Let me parse it again:

The SMILES is CC1CCC(=O)O1. So the ring is formed by the atoms connected to the closure '1'. So the ring is C1 connected to C, C, C, O1. The O1 is connected to the C1 via a single bond and has a double bond to O (from the =O). Wait, no. The part is CCC(=O)O1. So the O1 is part of the ring. So the ring is C1-C-C-C(=O)-O1, forming a five-membered ring (C1, C, C, C, O1). But that's five atoms. The C1 is connected to O1, which is part of the ring. The O1 has a double bond to O? No, the =O is on the C. So the structure is a five-membered ring where one of the carbons has a carbonyl group. 

In this case, the ring has one oxygen (O1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) on one of the carbons. So the ring is not fully saturated (due to the carbonyl), but according to the examples, this is considered a tetrahydrofuranone. Therefore, the definition must include such cases where the carbonyl is part of the ring. 

Therefore, the approach should be to find a five-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and at least one carbonyl group (C=O) either as part of the ring or as a substituent. 

But how to implement this using RDKit?

Steps:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. Check for the presence of a five-membered ring containing exactly one oxygen atom.
3. Check that within that ring, there is a carbonyl group (C=O) either as part of the ring or as a substituent.

Wait, but the carbonyl could be part of the ring. For example, in gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring. So the ring has a double bond (the carbonyl), making it unsaturated. But according to the problem's definition, the parent is oxolane (tetrahydrofuran), which is saturated. This is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the definition is incorrect, and the examples include both tetrahydrofuran derivatives with substituents and dihydrofuran derivatives (with one double bond). But given the examples, the correct approach is to detect a five-membered ring with one oxygen and at least one carbonyl group (as part of the ring or as a substituent).

So, the plan is:

- Find all rings in the molecule.
- Check for any five-membered ring that contains exactly one oxygen atom.
- For that ring, check if any of the atoms in the ring is a carbonyl carbon (i.e., has a double bond to oxygen) or if there's a substituent carbonyl group attached to the ring.

But how to implement this in RDKit?

First, find all rings of size 5. For each such ring, check if it contains exactly one oxygen atom. Then, check if any of the atoms in the ring is a carbonyl carbon (i.e., has a double bond to oxygen) or if there are any ketone groups attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the presence of a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl group (either in the ring or as a substituent).

But how to do that with SMARTS patterns.

A possible SMARTS pattern for the ring: a five-membered ring with one oxygen and at least one carbonyl group (C=O) either in the ring or attached to it.

But writing a SMARTS pattern for a five-membered ring with one O and a C=O somewhere.

Alternatively, break it into two parts:

1. The molecule must have a five-membered ring containing exactly one oxygen atom.
2. The molecule must have a carbonyl group (C=O) that is either part of the ring or attached to it.

Let's tackle part 1 first. A SMARTS pattern for a five-membered ring with exactly one oxygen.

The SMARTS for a five-membered ring with exactly one O could be something like:

[O;r5] but ensuring that the ring has exactly five atoms and only one oxygen.

But SMARTS is not straightforward for counting atoms in a ring. Instead, perhaps using RDKit's ring detection and then checking the ring sizes and oxygen counts.

So, in code:

- Iterate over all rings in the molecule.
- For each ring, check if the size is 5.
- Check if the ring contains exactly one oxygen atom.
- If such a ring exists, proceed to check for the presence of a carbonyl group in or attached to this ring.

Then, for part 2: check if there's a carbonyl group (C=O) either in the ring or as a substituent.

For the carbonyl in the ring: any carbon in the ring that is double-bonded to an oxygen.

For substituents: any carbon in the ring that has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (like a ketone substituent).

So, in code:

For each qualifying ring (5-membered, one O):

   For each atom in the ring:

      If the atom is a carbon and has a double bond to an oxygen (i.e., is a carbonyl carbon), then condition met.

   If not found, check if any atom in the ring has a substituent that is a carbonyl group (C=O).

Alternatively, check if any of the ring atoms have a neighboring carbonyl group.

Another approach: look for the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule, and check if the carbonyl carbon is either in the ring or adjacent to a ring atom.

But perhaps using SMARTS patterns would be more efficient.

A possible SMARTS pattern for a five-membered ring with one O and a carbonyl group (either in the ring or attached):

The ring part: O in a five-membered ring. The carbonyl could be inside or outside.

But writing this as a SMARTS pattern is tricky. Alternatively, use two separate patterns:

1. Five-membered ring with one O and a carbonyl in the ring.

Pattern: [O;r5]@*@*@*@* where one of the atoms is a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps:

The SMARTS for a five-membered ring containing one O and a carbonyl (C=O) in the ring would be:

[O]1-*-*-*-C(=O)-1

But this would represent a five-membered ring where the O is connected to three atoms, then a C=O. But this may not capture all possibilities.

Alternatively, a more flexible approach is needed.

Alternatively, use the following steps in code:

Loop through all rings of size 5:

   If the ring has exactly one O:

      Check if any atom in the ring is a carbonyl carbon (i.e., has a double bond to O).

      If yes, return True.

      Else, check if any atom in the ring has a substituent that is a carbonyl group.

So, in code:

for ring in rings:

   if len(ring) ==5:

      o_count = sum(1 for atom in ring if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 8)

      if o_count ==1:

          # Check for carbonyl in the ring

          has_carbonyl_in_ring = False

          for atom_idx in ring:

              atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)

              if atom.GetAtomicNum() ==6:

                  for bond in atom.GetBonds():

                      if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:

                          neighbor = bond.GetOtherAtom(atom)

                          if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() ==8 and bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:

                              has_carbonyl_in_ring = True

                              break

                  if has_carbonyl_in_ring:

                      break

          if has_carbonyl_in_ring:

              return True

          # Check for substituent carbonyl

          for atom_idx in ring:

              atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)

              for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():

                  if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() ==6 and any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in neighbor.GetBonds()):

                      # Check if neighbor is part of a carbonyl group

                      for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():

                          if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE and bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor).GetAtomicNum() ==8:

                              return True

          # If none found, continue

If any ring satisfies these conditions, return True.

This approach would check for carbonyl groups either in the ring or as substituents.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, using SMARTS patterns for both scenarios.

First scenario: carbonyl in the ring.

SMARTS pattern for a five-membered ring with one O and a carbonyl in the ring:

[$([O]1-@*-@*-@*-@C(=O)-1)]

But this is not flexible. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches any five-membered ring containing an O and a C=O.

Another approach: use two separate SMARTS patterns.

Pattern 1: Five-membered ring with O and C=O in the ring.

Pattern 2: Five-membered ring with O and a C=O attached as a substituent.

For Pattern 1:

The SMARTS could be:

[O]1~*~*~*~C(=O)~1

But this might not capture all possible arrangements. For example, the O and C=O could be in any positions in the ring.

Alternatively, use a more general pattern:

[O;r5]@[C;r5]@[C;r5]@[C;r5]@[C;r5](=O)

But this requires that the C=O is in the ring. However, the exact positions can vary.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches any atom in the ring that is a carbonyl carbon:

[O;r5].&[C;r5]=O

But this may not work as intended. Maybe using the RDKit's HasSubstructMatch with a pattern that finds a five-membered ring with O and a C=O.

Alternatively, create a SMARTS for a five-membered ring containing an O and a C=O:

The SMARTS would be:

[O]1-*-*-*-C(=O)-1

But this is a specific arrangement. To make it more general, perhaps:

[O]1-*-*-*-*-1.C(=O)

But this would match any molecule with a five-membered ring containing an O and any C=O, but not necessarily connected.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that ensures the C=O is part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps using the ring closure notation. For example:

[O]1-C-C-C-C(=O)-1

But this is a specific arrangement. To generalize, perhaps:

[O]1-*-*-*-C(=O)-1

But this would require the O and C=O to be adjacent in the ring, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that allows any arrangement in the ring:

[O;r5].&[C;r5]=O

But I'm not sure how to combine these in SMARTS.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps using the code approach is better.

Another idea: find all five-membered rings with one O, then check each atom in the ring to see if it has a double bond to O (i.e., is a carbonyl carbon in the ring) or if any substituent of the ring is a carbonyl group.

So, in code:

mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)

if not mol:

   return False, "Invalid SMILES"

rings = mol.GetRingInfo().AtomRings()

found = False

for ring in rings:

   if len(ring) !=5:

       continue

   o_count = sum(1 for atom_idx in ring if mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx).GetAtomicNum() ==8)

   if o_count !=1:

       continue

   # Check for carbonyl in the ring

   for atom_idx in ring:

       atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)

       if atom.GetAtomicNum() !=6:

           continue

       for bond in atom.GetBonds():

           if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:

But this code has some issues. For example, when checking substituents, it checks if any neighbor of a ring atom has a double bond to O. But this could be part of a different group, like
