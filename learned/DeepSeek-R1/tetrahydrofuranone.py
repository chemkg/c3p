Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was really low, so there must be a lot of false positives and negatives. Looking at the outcomes, there are many false positives where the model incorrectly classified molecules as tetrahydrofuranones. The main issue seems to be that the code considered both carbonyl groups in the ring and as substituents. But according to the definition, tetrahydrofuranone is an oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) with an oxo substituent. Wait, the definition says "oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring." So the oxo group (C=O) should be part of the ring structure, not just any substituent. 

Wait, oxolane is the saturated five-membered ring with one oxygen. So the oxo group (a carbonyl) must be attached to the ring. But in the previous code, they checked for a carbonyl in the ring (like part of the ring atoms) or as a substituent. But if the carbonyl is part of the ring, that would mean the ring has a double bond (like a lactone, which is a cyclic ester). But maybe the correct approach is to look for a five-membered oxolane ring (with one oxygen) that has a carbonyl group (C=O) as a substituent on any of the ring atoms. Wait, no—if the oxo is part of the ring, like in a cyclic ketone. For example, gamma-valerolactone is a cyclic ester (the carbonyl is part of the ring), but that's a lactone, not a ketone. Wait, the definition says "oxo substituent"—so maybe the carbonyl is a substituent on the ring, not part of the ring itself. 

Wait, looking at the examples given, like gamma-valerolactone (SMILES CC1CCC(=O)O1). The structure is a five-membered ring where one of the carbons is a carbonyl. Wait, gamma-valerolactone is a cyclic ester, so the carbonyl is part of the ring. But according to the problem statement, those examples are correct. So maybe the definition allows the oxo group to be part of the ring. Wait, the definition says "Any oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring." Oxolane is tetrahydrofuran, which is a five-membered saturated ring with one oxygen. An oxo substituent would be a ketone group (C=O) attached to one of the carbons in the ring. But in gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring as an ester (O-C=O). Wait, but gamma-valerolactone's structure is a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl group as part of the ring. So maybe the code needs to check for a five-membered ring with one oxygen (oxolane) and a carbonyl group (either as part of the ring or as a substituent). But according to the false positives, some molecules that have a five-membered ring with an oxygen and a carbonyl elsewhere are being incorrectly classified. 

Wait, looking at the false positives, like Gamma-Abscisolactone has a five-membered ring with a carbonyl, but perhaps it's a lactone (ester) rather than a ketone. The problem is that the previous code checks for any carbonyl group either in the ring or as a substituent, but maybe it's allowing lactones (which are esters) when the definition requires a ketone (oxo group as a substituent on the ring). 

Wait, the definition says "oxo substituent"—oxo is a ketone group, which is a carbonyl (C=O) attached to a carbon. So if the carbonyl is part of the ring (like in an ester, lactone), that's not a substituent. So maybe the code is incorrectly including lactones (which have the carbonyl as part of the ring) as tetrahydrofuranones, but according to the problem statement, those examples (like gamma-valerolactone) are correct. Wait, but the problem statement says that gamma-valerolactone is a correct example, which is a lactone. So maybe the definition includes both lactones (where the carbonyl is part of the ring) and ketones (where the carbonyl is a substituent). 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the definition again. The problem statement says: "Any oxolane having an oxo- substituent at any position on the tetrahydrofuran ring." Oxolane is the tetrahydrofuran ring (saturated five-membered with one O). An oxo substituent is a =O group attached to a carbon in the ring. So the oxo is a substituent, meaning that the ring carbon has a double bond to oxygen (i.e., a ketone group). But in lactones (like gamma-valerolactone), the carbonyl is part of the ester group, which is part of the ring. Wait, gamma-valerolactone's structure is O-C(=O)- as part of the ring. So in that case, the carbonyl is part of the ring structure, not a substituent. But according to the examples given, gamma-valerolactone is considered a tetrahydrofuranone, which suggests that the definition includes lactones. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the code had some other issues.

Looking at the previous code, it checks for a five-membered ring with exactly one oxygen. Then, it looks for a carbonyl group either in the ring (as a double bond between C and O in the ring) or as a substituent. But in the case of gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring (as part of the ester). So the code would detect the carbonyl in the ring and return true, which is correct. But why are there false positives then?

Looking at the false positives, for example, Gamma-Abscisolactone (SMILES O=C1C(O)=CC(C)(C)C(=C1C)/C=C/2\OC(=O)C=C2C). The code might detect a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl in the ring. But maybe that's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the code is considering any five-membered ring with an oxygen and a carbonyl, but some of those rings are not oxolane (tetrahydrofuran) rings. For example, if the ring has more than one oxygen, or if the ring is not fully saturated. Wait, oxolane is tetrahydrofuran, which is fully saturated. So the code should check that the ring is fully saturated (all single bonds) except for the carbonyl group. But the previous code didn't check for saturation. So if there's a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl, but the ring has other double bonds, it's not a tetrahydrofuranone. For example, if the ring is a furan (with a double bond), then it's not oxolane. So the code needs to ensure that the ring is fully saturated except for the carbonyl group.

Ah, that's the problem! The previous code didn't check if the ring is saturated (i.e., all single bonds except for the carbonyl). So molecules with other double bonds in the ring would be incorrectly classified. For example, if there's a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl, but also another double bond, then it's not a tetrahydrofuranone. The code needs to verify that the ring is fully saturated except for the carbonyl group.

So, to fix the false positives, the code should check that the five-membered ring with one oxygen is fully saturated (all single bonds except for the carbonyl group). Additionally, the code should ensure that the carbonyl is part of the ring (as in lactones) or as a substituent (as in ketones). 

Another possible issue is that the code checks for any carbonyl group in the ring, but maybe it's part of a different functional group. For example, in an ester group (like lactones), the carbonyl is part of the ring. The code allows that, which is correct based on the examples. However, the false positives might have rings that are not oxolane (e.g., containing other heteroatoms or having more than one oxygen). Wait, the code checks for exactly one oxygen in the ring. So that part is correct.

So the main issue causing false positives is that the code allows rings with additional double bonds (other than the carbonyl). For example, a furan derivative with a carbonyl substituent would have a five-membered ring with one oxygen and a carbonyl, but the ring itself has a double bond (not saturated), so it's not an oxolane. The code should check that the ring is fully saturated except for the carbonyl group.

How to implement that? For each five-membered ring with one oxygen, check that all bonds in the ring are single bonds, except possibly one double bond (the carbonyl). Wait, but in lactones, the carbonyl is part of the ring (as in gamma-valerolactone: the ring is O-C-C-C-C-O, with a carbonyl between O and C). Wait, gamma-valerolactone's structure is O-C(=O)-C-C-C. So the ring has a double bond as part of the carbonyl. So the ring has one double bond (the carbonyl), and the rest are single bonds. Therefore, the code should allow exactly one double bond in the ring (the carbonyl). But how to check that?

So for the five-membered ring with one oxygen, check that there is exactly one double bond in the ring, and that this double bond is part of a carbonyl group (C=O). Alternatively, check that all ring bonds are single except for one double bond that is between a carbon and an oxygen.

Wait, but in the case of a substituent carbonyl (like a ketone attached to the ring), the ring itself is fully saturated (all single bonds), and the carbonyl is a substituent. For example, if the ring is oxolane (all single bonds) and one of the carbons has a =O substituent. In that case, the ring has no double bonds, but the substituent has a double bond. The code needs to account for both cases: carbonyl in the ring (as part of a lactone) or as a substituent (as a ketone).

So the previous code's approach was to check both possibilities. However, in the case where the ring has other double bonds (not part of a carbonyl), the code would still consider it a tetrahydrofuranone, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code should:

1. Find all five-membered rings with exactly one oxygen atom.
2. For each such ring, check that the ring is either:
   a. Fully saturated (all single bonds) and has a carbonyl group (C=O) as a substituent on any ring atom.
   b. Contains exactly one double bond, which is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) within the ring (like in lactones).

But how to implement this in RDKit?

First, for each five-membered ring with one oxygen:

- Check the number of double bonds in the ring. If there's one double bond, ensure it's part of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the ring.
- If there are no double bonds in the ring, check for a carbonyl substituent attached to any ring atom.

Alternatively, for the ring to be an oxolane (tetrahydrofuran), it must be fully saturated except for the carbonyl group. So:

- The ring should have either 0 or 1 double bonds.
- If 1 double bond, it must be part of a carbonyl group in the ring.
- If 0 double bonds, there must be a carbonyl substituent attached to the ring.

Let's try to implement this.

First, for each five-membered ring with one oxygen:

Check the ring's bonds. Count the number of double bonds in the ring. If there's a double bond, it must be between a carbon and an oxygen (i.e., part of a carbonyl group). For substituent case (no ring double bonds), check if any ring atom has a substituent with a carbonyl group.

So steps:

For each 5-membered ring with exactly one O:

   a. Check if the ring has exactly one double bond. If yes, check if that bond is part of a carbonyl (C=O) in the ring.

   b. If the ring has no double bonds, check if any atom in the ring has a substituent with a carbonyl group (C=O).

If either a or b is true, then it's a tetrahydrofuranone.

This should cover both cases: lactones (where the carbonyl is in the ring) and ketones (where the carbonyl is a substituent).

In the previous code, the check for the carbonyl in the ring may not have properly accounted for whether the double bond is part of the ring. For example, in gamma-valerolactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring, so the ring has one double bond (the carbonyl). The code's first case (carbonyl_in_ring) would detect this. But the code didn't check if the ring has other double bonds.

So the problem with the previous code was that it allowed rings with more than one double bond (as long as there's a carbonyl in the ring). For example, if a ring has two double bonds, one of which is a carbonyl, the code would still return true. But such a ring is not an oxolane (tetrahydrofuran), which is fully saturated except for the carbonyl.

Therefore, the code should first check that the ring has either 0 or 1 double bonds, and that any double bond is part of a carbonyl.

Implementing this:

For each 5-membered ring with one O:

   - Get all bonds in the ring.

   - Count the number of double bonds in the ring.

   - If the count is 0:

      - Check if any ring atom has a substituent with a carbonyl group (C=O).

   - If the count is 1:

      - Check that the double bond is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the ring.

   - If count >1: reject.

So, in code:

For each ring in the 5-membered rings with one O:

   ring_bonds = [mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(a, b) for a, b in zip(ring, ring[1:] + ring[:1])]

   double_bonds_in_ring = [bond for bond in ring_bonds if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE]

   if len(double_bonds_in_ring) > 1:

       continue

   elif len(double_bonds_in_ring) == 1:

       # Check if this double bond is part of a carbonyl (C=O)

       bond = double_bonds_in_ring[0]

       a1 = bond.GetBeginAtom()

       a2 = bond.GetEndAtom()

       # One of the atoms must be O and the other C?

       # Wait, carbonyl is C=O. So the bond is between C and O.

       # So check if one is C and the other O.

       if (a1.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and a2.GetAtomicNum() == 8) or (a1.GetAtomicNum() == 8 and a2.GetAtomicNum() == 6):

           # It's a carbonyl in the ring.

           return True, "..."

       else:

           # The double bond is not part of a carbonyl.

           continue

   else: # no double bonds in ring

       # Check substituents for carbonyl

       for atom_idx in ring:

           atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)

           for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():

               if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:

                   for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():

                       if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:

                           other = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)

                           if other.GetAtomicNum() == 8 and neighbor.GetIdx() not in ring:

                               return True, "..."

       # Also check if the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring.

       # Alternatively, use SMARTS patterns.

Wait, perhaps using SMARTS patterns would be more efficient.

Another approach: Use SMARTS to match the two cases.

Case 1: Five-membered ring with one O, exactly one double bond which is C=O in the ring.

SMARTS for a five-membered ring (oxolane) with one O and a carbonyl in the ring:

The ring would have atoms: O and four Cs. One of the Cs is double-bonded to O (as part of the ring).

So the SMARTS pattern would be like:

[O]1-C(=O)-C-C-C-1

But need to account for any position. So perhaps:

[O]1-*@[C](=O)-*-*-*-1

Alternatively, a SMARTS pattern that matches any five-membered ring with one O and a carbonyl group in the ring.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that looks for a five-membered ring containing an O and a C=O group where the C=O is part of the ring.

But creating such a SMARTS can be tricky. Alternatively, use the SMARTS for a five-membered ring with one O and a C=O in the ring:

"[O;r5]@[C;r5]=O"

But that might not capture all cases. Alternatively, find all rings of size 5, check for one O, and then check if there's a C=O in the ring.

Alternatively, for the case where the ring has one double bond (C=O), we can check if the ring has a carbonyl group as part of it.

For the substituent case (no double bonds in the ring), check if any ring atom has a carbonyl group attached (like a ketone).

So combining these two cases with SMARTS patterns:

Case 1: Five-membered ring with one O and a C=O in the ring (lactone-like structure).

SMARTS pattern: 

"[#8]1-*-[C](=O)-*-*-1"

But this is not flexible. Alternatively, use a SMARTS that matches any five-membered ring containing exactly one O and a C=O group, where the C=O is part of the ring.

Alternatively, use the following approach:

For each 5-membered ring with one O:

   Check if there's a C=O in the ring (i.e., a carbonyl where both atoms are in the ring).

   If yes, then check that the ring has exactly one double bond (the C=O).

   Or, if there's a C=O in the ring, then it's case 1.

For case 2 (substituent):

   The ring has no double bonds, and a substituent with C=O attached to any ring atom.

So, in code:

for ring in rings:

   if len(ring) ==5 and o_count ==1:

       # Check case 1: C=O in ring

       # Find if any C=O in the ring

       has_carbonyl_in_ring = False

       for bond in ring_bonds:

           if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:

               a1 = bond.GetBeginAtom()

               a2 = bond.GetEndAtom()

               if {a1.GetAtomicNum(), a2.GetAtomicNum()} == {6,8}:

                   has_carbonyl_in_ring = True

                   break

       if has_carbonyl_in_ring:

           # Check that there's only one double bond in the ring

           if len(double_bonds_in_ring) ==1:

               return True, "..."

       else:

           # Check case 2: substituent C=O

           # For each atom in the ring, check if it has a substituent with C=O

           for atom_idx in ring:

               atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)

               for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():

                   if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() ==6 and any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in neighbor.GetBonds() if bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor).GetAtomicNum() ==8):

                       return True, "..."

So combining these checks.

Now, let's see why the previous code failed. For example, in the false positives like Gamma-Abscisolactone, the code might have detected a five-membered ring with one O and a carbonyl in the ring, but the ring might have more than one double bond. For example, if the ring has two double bonds (one being the carbonyl), then the previous code would still accept it, but according to the definition, the ring should be oxolane (saturated except for the carbonyl).

So adding a check that the ring has exactly one double bond (the carbonyl) in case 1, and no double bonds in case 2, would help eliminate false positives.

Another possible issue: the previous code allowed substituent carbonyls that are part of other rings. For example, if a substituent is part of another ring, but the code still counts it. But according to the definition, the substituent must be on the oxolane ring.

So, to summarize, the revised code should:

1. Find all five-membered rings with exactly one oxygen atom.

2. For each such ring:

   a. Check if the ring contains a carbonyl group (C=O) as part of the ring. If yes, ensure that the ring has exactly one double bond (the carbonyl).

   b. If the ring has no double bonds, check if any atom in the ring has a substituent with a carbonyl group (C=O).

If either a or b is true, then it's a tetrahydrofuranone.

Implementing this in code:

- For each ring, first check if it's a five-membered ring with one O.

- For each such ring, get all bonds in the ring.

- Count the number of double bonds in the ring.

- For case a (carbonyl in ring):

   - Check if there's a C=O in the ring.

   - If yes and the count of double bonds is 1, return True.

- For case b (substituent):

   - If count of double bonds is 0, check for any substituent C=O.

So, here's the revised code:

from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Mol

def is_tetrahydrofuranone(smiles: str):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if mol is None:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES string"
    
    # Get all rings in the molecule
    ring_info = mol.GetRingInfo()
    atom_rings = ring_info.AtomRings()
    
    for ring in atom_rings:
        if len(ring) != 5:
            continue
        # Check for exactly one oxygen in the ring
        o_count = sum(1 for atom_idx in ring if mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx).GetAtomicNum() == 8)
        if o_count != 1:
            continue
        
        # Get all bonds in the ring
        ring_bonds = []
        for i in range(len(ring)):

            a2 = ring[(i+1)%len(ring)]
            bond = mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(a1, a2)
            if bond:

        # Count double bonds in the ring

        num_double = len(double_bonds_in_ring)
        
        # Case 1: Check if the ring has a carbonyl (C=O) and exactly one double bond
        has_carbonyl_in_ring = False
        for bond in double_bonds_in_ring:
            a1 = bond.GetBeginAtom()
            a2 = bond.GetEndAtom()
            if {a1.GetAtomicNum(), a2.GetAtomicNum()} == {6, 8}:
                has_carbonyl_in_ring = True
                break
        
        if has_carbonyl_in_ring and num_double == 1:
            return True, "Five-membered oxolane ring with carbonyl group in the ring"
        
        # Case 2: No double bonds in ring, check for substituent carbonyl
        if num_double == 0:
            # Check each atom in the ring for a substituent with C=O
            for atom_idx in ring:
                atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)
                for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
                    if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
                        # Check if neighbor has a double bond to oxygen
                        for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
                            if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:
                                other = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                                if other.GetAtomicNum() == 8 and neighbor.GetIdx() not in ring:
                                    return True, "Five-membered oxolane ring with carbonyl substituent"
    
    return False, "No five-membered oxolane ring with oxo substituent found"

This code should handle both cases: rings with a carbonyl (lactones) and rings with a substituent carbonyl (ketones). It also ensures that the ring has the correct number of double bonds (0 or 1) and that any double bond is part of a carbonyl group. This should reduce false positives by rejecting rings with extra double bonds or incorrect substituents.
