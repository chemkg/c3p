Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The main issue seems to be that all the test cases were missed because the L-serine moiety wasn't detected properly. The error messages mention "Missing L-serine moiety with correct stereochemistry". Let's look at the previous code's approach to detecting serine.

The previous code used a SMARTS pattern for serine: `[NH2,NH3+][C@](C(=O)[O-,OH])([OH,O-])OP(=O)([O-])[O-]`. Maybe this pattern is too strict. Let's break down what's in the SMILES examples.

Looking at the example SMILES, the serine part is usually something like `OC[C@H](N)C(O)=O` (like in the first example). The pattern should account for the amino group (N), the central chiral carbon (with correct stereochemistry), the carboxylate (COO), and the phosphate connection.

Wait, in the previous SMARTS, the pattern starts with [NH2,NH3+], but in the SMILES examples, the serine's amino group might be protonated (like `[NH3+]` in some cases) or not. Also, the carboxylate could be in different forms (like `C(O)=O` vs `C(=O)O
