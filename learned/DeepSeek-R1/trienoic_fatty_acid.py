Okay, let's try to figure out why the previous code didn't work. The user mentioned an "unexpected indent" error, which usually means there's a problem with the code's formatting, like spaces or tabs where they shouldn't be. Looking at the previous code, I notice that the examples provided are just SMILES strings and not actual code. The user probably pasted the examples instead of the code, causing syntax errors.

Now, focusing on the task: create a function called is_trienoic_fatty_acid that checks if a SMILES string is a trienoic fatty acid. The definition is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds.

First, I need to ensure the molecule is a fatty acid. That means it should have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Using RDKit, I can search for the COOH group. Then, check for exactly three double bonds. Also, it should be a polyunsaturated fatty acid, so the double bonds should be non-conjugated, but maybe that's too specific. For simplicity, count the number of double bonds and ensure there are three.

Steps:
1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. Check for a carboxylic acid group (COOH).
3. Count the number of double bonds in the molecule.
4. Ensure there are exactly three double bonds.
5. Optional: Check if it's a long-chain fatty acid, maybe by carbon count.

Wait, but some examples have modifications like hydroxyl or epoxy groups. The core is three double bonds and a carboxylic acid. So the main checks are COOH and three double bonds.

Potential issues in previous attempts: Maybe not checking for the carboxylic acid properly, or miscounting double bonds. Let's structure the code step by step.

Implementing in RDKit:
- Use MolFromSmiles to get the molecule.
- Check if the molecule is valid.
- Use the SMARTS pattern for carboxylic acid: [CX3](=O)[OX2H1].
- Count the number of double bonds with GetNumDoubleBonds().
- If both conditions are met (carboxylic acid and 3 double bonds), return True.

Also, need to handle cases where the molecule is invalid. Let's test this logic with the examples provided. For instance, 9Z,12Z,15E-octadecatrienoic acid has a COOH and three double bonds. The code should catch that. Modifications like hydroxyls shouldn't affect the count of double bonds.

Wait, but what about conjugated double bonds? The problem states "polyunsaturated", which usually means multiple double bonds separated by single bonds. But the definition here is any three double bonds. So maybe the code doesn't need to check their positions, just the count.

So the code steps would be:
1. Check valid SMILES.
2. Check for at least one carboxylic acid group.
3. Count all double bonds in the molecule.
4. If count is exactly three, return True.

This should cover all examples, even those with other functional groups as long as they have three double bonds and a COOH.

Let me write the code accordingly, making sure there are no syntax errors this time. Also, need to return the reason for classification.

Another thing: sometimes SMILES might have explicit hydrogens, but RDKit's MolFromSmiles should handle that. The SMARTS pattern for COOH should account for possible H atoms.

Testing with the example SMILES strings should validate this approach. For example, Fervenulin (last example) has a COOH? Let me check its SMILES: O=C1N(C(=O)C=2N=CN=NC2N1C)C. It has two carbonyl groups, but no carboxylic acid (no -OH attached to carbonyl). So the code should correctly exclude it.

Thus, the code should correctly identify trienoic fatty acids by checking COOH and three double bonds.
