Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The main issue was that the core structure pattern wasn't matching any of the test cases. Let me look at the SMARTS pattern used in the previous code.

The core_pattern was written as "[C@@]([CH2]OC(=O)*)([CH2]OC(=O)*)([H])OP(=[O])([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C". Hmm, maybe the way the ester groups are specified is too restrictive. The "*" in SMARTS might not be matching the actual chains properly. Also, the previous code used [CH2] for both positions 1 and 2, but in some SMILES examples, those might be CH groups instead of CH2. Wait, looking at the example SMILES like "C([C@@](COC(...", the glycerol backbone has a CH2 (COC...), a CH (OC...), and another CH2 (with [H]). So maybe the SMARTS needs to account for that.

Another problem might be the stereochemistry. The previous code used [C@@], but maybe the exact configuration needs to be adjusted. Also, the phosphocholine group's structure might not have been matched correctly. Let me check the SMILES examples. The phosphocholine part is "OP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C" in some cases. The previous SMARTS had "OP(=[O])([O-])OCC...", which might not account for the possible order of the oxygen atoms.

Also, the ester group check might have been too strict. The previous code looked for "[O;X2]C(=O)", but maybe there are cases where the ester is connected to a longer chain. Additionally, the fatty acid pattern check using "[O;X2][CX4][CX4][CX3]=O" might not be sufficient. Some fatty acids have double bonds, which are represented with \C=C\ in SMILES, so the pattern needs to account for that.

So, to fix the core structure matching, I need to adjust the SMARTS pattern to correctly represent the glycerol backbone with the two ester groups and the phosphocholine group. Let's try building the core pattern step by step. The glycerol should have three oxygen-bearing carbons: two with ester groups (positions 1 and 2) and one with the phosphocholine (position 3). The stereochemistry at the central carbon (sn-position) is crucial. The SMARTS should enforce the correct configuration.

Maybe the core pattern should be written as:
- The central carbon (C@@) connected to:
  - CH2-O-C(=O) (position 1)
  - CH-O-C(=O) (position 2)
  - CH2-OP(...) (position 3)
Wait, looking at the example SMILES, like "C([C@@](COC(...", the central carbon is attached to COC (position 1), OC (position 2), and OP (position 3). So the SMARTS should reflect that. The positions might be in the order: COC(=O) (position 1), OC(=O) (position 2), and OP (position 3). Also, the hydrogen is attached to the central carbon, indicating the sn configuration.

So the correct SMARTS pattern for the core would be something like:
[C@@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+])(COC(=O)*)OC(=O)*

Wait, but in SMARTS, the order of substituents matters. Let me construct it properly. The central carbon (C) with four bonds: one to H (for the sn configuration), one to the phosphocholine group, one to the first ester (COC...), and one to the second ester (OC...). So the SMARTS pattern should be:
[C@@H](COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C)(COC(=O)*)OC(=O)*

But maybe using more precise SMARTS with proper atom mappings. Let me try this:

The core SMARTS could be:
"[C@@H](COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C)(COC(=O)*)OC(=O)*"

But I need to make sure that the ester groups are attached correctly. Also, the previous code's pattern might have had [CH2] instead of [CH], which could be a mistake. For example, in the SMILES examples, the central carbon is attached to a COC (which is a CH2-O-...), so maybe the first substituent is a CH2-O-C(=O), the second is a CH-O-C(=O), and the third is the CH2-OP group. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The glycerol backbone is:

CH2-O-acyl
|
CH-O-acyl
|
CH2-OP...

So the central carbon (the second CH) has three substituents: the first CH2-O-acyl (position 1), the second O-acyl (position 2), and the CH2-OP group (position 3). But the stereochemistry is important here. The sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine has the phosphocholine at position 3. The SMILES examples use the [O@@] configuration for the central carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the core SMARTS should look for the central carbon in
