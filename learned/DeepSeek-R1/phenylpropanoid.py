Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The error message says "unexpected indent" which usually means there's a problem with the code's formatting, like spaces or tabs where they shouldn't be. Looking at the previous code, it seems like the user included a lot of SMILES examples directly in the code block, which isn't valid Python. The code block should only contain the function and necessary imports, not data examples.

Now, focusing on the task: classify phenylpropanoids. The definition says they have a phenylpropane skeleton (C6-C3). So the core structure is a benzene ring connected to a three-carbon chain. Examples include flavonoids, coumarins, etc.

To detect this, the code should check for a benzene ring (aromatic) attached to a three-carbon chain. The three-carbon chain might have various substituents or be part of a larger structure like a coumarin or flavone.

So, the plan is:
1. Check for at least one aromatic benzene ring.
2. Check if there's a three-carbon chain attached to the benzene. This chain could be propyl, propenyl, or part of a cyclic structure (like in coumarins).
3. Allow for various functional groups and substitutions on the benzene and the chain.

Using RDKit, we can search for the benzene ring and then look for a three-carbon chain connected to it. SMARTS patterns can help here. For example, a benzene ring with a propyl group: c1ccccc1CCC. But since the chain can be modified (like with double bonds or oxygen atoms in coumarins), the pattern needs to be flexible.

Possible SMARTS patterns:
- Benzene connected to a propyl group: [c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1-[CX4]-[CX4]-[CX4]-*
- Or a propenyl group: [c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1-C=C-C-*
- Also, check for cyclic structures where the three carbons are part of a ring (like coumarin's lactone ring).

Additionally, the molecule should be organic (no metals, etc.), but maybe that's assumed here.

Testing the code with the examples provided: for instance, 4-phenylcoumarin has a benzene attached to a coumarin structure, which includes the three-carbon chain as part of the lactone ring. The code should recognize that.

Potential issues:
- Ensuring that the three-carbon chain is correctly identified in various configurations.
- Handling complex structures where the chain is part of a ring or has functional groups.

So, the function will parse the SMILES, check for the benzene ring, then check if there's a three-carbon chain attached. If both are present, return True with the reason.

Let's draft the code accordingly.
