But wait, the sugar_pattern is still using a SMARTS that may not correctly identify the sugar. The pattern "[O]1-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C]-1-CO" looks for a five-membered ring starting with O, followed by four carbons, and a CO group. But in reality, the CO is attached to one of the carbons in the ring, not as a separate atom. For example, in ribose, the CO is attached to C5 (which is outside the ring?), but in the furanose form, the hydroxymethyl is part of the ring.

Wait, no. In the furanose form, the ring is five-membered (O, C1, C2, C3, C4), and the hydroxymethyl (C5) is attached to C4. So the CO group is outside the ring. So the SMARTS pattern should look for a five-membered ring with O, and a hydroxymethyl group attached to one of the ring carbons.

So the correct SMARTS would be:

[O]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]1CO)O)O)O

But this includes specific hydroxyls. To ignore substituents, use:

[O]1[C][C][C][C]1CO

But this would match any five-membered ring with O and a CO group attached.

But in SMARTS, the pattern [O]1[C][C][C][C]1-CO would match O connected to C1, which is connected to C2, C3, C4, and back to O1 (forming a five-membered ring), and C4 has a CO group.

Wait, no. The pattern [O]1-C-C-C-C-1-CO would form a six-membered ring (O1-C-C-C-C-O1) plus a CO group. Not correct.

Alternatively, the pattern should be [O]1-C-C-C-C-1-C-O, which is a five-membered ring (O-C-C-C-C) with a CO group attached to one of the carbons.

But SMARTS uses numbers to indicate ring closures. So the correct SMARTS for a five-membered ring with O and a CO group attached to one of the carbons would be:

[O]1-C-C-C-C-1-CO

But this would form a six-membered ring (O1-C-C-C-C-O1) plus CO. Not correct.

Hmm, this is tricky. Perhaps the correct SMARTS is:

[O]1-C(-CO)-C-C-C-1

This creates a five-membered ring where one of the carbons is attached to a CO group.

But I'm not confident. Given time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use a more flexible sugar pattern and focus on the N-glycosidic bond and nucleobase detection.

In the previous code, the main issue was that the sugar_pattern was too strict. So, removing the stereochemistry and some hydroxyl checks might help.

Revising the sugar_pattern to:

sugar_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[C@H]1([C@@H](CO)O[C@@H]([C@H]1O)*)O")

But this is still not right. Alternatively, use a generic pattern that matches any five-membered ring with O and a CO group:

sugar_core = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[O]1-*-*-*-*-1-CO")

But this may not work.

Given the time, I'll proceed with the revised code that relaxes the sugar detection and improves the nucleobase check. The key changes are:

1. Use a more general sugar pattern that looks for a five-membered ring with O and CO group.
2. Check for the N-glycosidic bond using a pattern that looks for a ring oxygen connected to a ring carbon connected to a nitrogen.
3. Check if the nitrogen is part of a ring with multiple nitrogens (indicative of a nucleobase).

This should handle more variations and modified sugars/bases.
