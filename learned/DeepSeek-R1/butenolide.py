</think>

Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was low, so there were both false positives and false negatives. 

First, looking at the false positives: some molecules were incorrectly classified as butenolides. For example, "Istanbulin A" has a five-membered lactone ring but maybe isn't a 2-furanone. The previous code checked for a five-membered ring with one oxygen, a carbonyl, and a double bond. But maybe some structures have the carbonyl not in the right position or other substituents that don't fit the butenolide definition.

Then the false negatives: some valid butenolides were missed. For instance, "dihydroouabain" wasn't detected. The code might have failed to find the ring because of hydrogen atoms in the SMILES, or maybe the conjugated double bond check was too strict. Also, the code checked for any double bond in the ring, but maybe the specific arrangement (like the 2-furanone structure) wasn't enforced.

The key issue is that the previous approach didn't accurately capture the 2-furanone skeleton. A 2-furanone has the carbonyl at position 2, adjacent to the oxygen. The code checked for any carbonyl in the ring, not specifically in the correct position. Also, the conjugated double bond might need to be between the oxygen and the carbonyl.

To fix this, I should use SMARTS patterns that precisely match the 2-furanone structure. The correct pattern would be a five-membered ring where the oxygen is at one position, followed by a double bond (like O-C=C-O-C=O arrangement). But building the exact SMARTS for gamma-lactone (which is a five-membered lactone) with the 2-furanone skeleton is crucial.

Another point: the previous code looked for any double bond in the ring, but in 2-furanone, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (assuming O is at position 1). So the SMARTS should enforce that the carbonyl is adjacent to the oxygen with a conjugated double bond.

So the plan is:
1. Use a SMARTS pattern that matches the 2-furanone core: a five-membered ring with oxygen, a conjugated carbonyl, and the lactone ester linkage (O-C(=O)- as part of the ring).
2. Ensure the lactone is a gamma-lactone (five-membered ring), so the ester oxygen is part of the ring.
3. Check for substituents, but allow derivatives as per the class definition.

The SMARTS pattern for 2-furanone would be something like "*O1C=C(C(=O)O1)*", but need to adjust for ring closure. Alternatively, a more precise pattern like "[O;r5]C(=O)C=C" within a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the correct SMARTS is "[O;r5][C;r5]=[C;r5][C;r5](=[O;r5])[C;r5]". But that might not capture all substitutions. Alternatively, a pattern that matches the core structure but allows substitutions.

Another approach: the 2-furanone skeleton is a five-membered ring where the oxygen is at position 1, followed by a double bond (positions 1-2), then a carbonyl (positions 3-4). So the SMARTS could be "O1C=CC(=O)C1". But that's a specific arrangement. However, substituents can be present, so using a more flexible SMARTS like "O1C(=O)C=CC1" might work, but maybe allowing any substituents as long as the core is present.

Alternatively, using a SMARTS that matches the lactone (ester) group in a five-membered ring. The lactone would have the ester oxygen in the ring. So the pattern would be "[O;r5][C;r5](=O)[C;r5]=[C;r5][C;r5]". But ensuring that the carbonyl is part of the ring and adjacent to the oxygen.

Wait, the gamma-lactone (five-membered) has the ester linkage where the oxygen is part of the ring. So the structure is O-C-C-C(=O)-O (but in a ring). Wait, no, gamma-lactone is a cyclic ester where the ester oxygen is part of a five-membered ring. The structure would be O connected to a carbon, which is connected via three carbons to the carbonyl, then back to the oxygen to form the ring. So the correct arrangement is O-C-C-C-C(=O)-O, but in a five-membered ring. Wait, noâ€”gamma-lactone is a four-membered lactone? Wait no, gamma is the third carbon, so gamma-lactone is a five-membered ring. The lactone forms when the hydroxyl group is on the fourth carbon relative to the carbonyl. So the ring would be O-C-C-C-C(=O), connected back to the O. So the SMARTS for the lactone would be O1C-C-C-C(=O)-1. But in 2-furanone, the carbonyl is adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, 2-furanone has the structure O=C1C=CC(O1). So the carbonyl is at position 2. Therefore, the SMARTS pattern should capture that.

So the correct SMARTS for 2-furanone is "[O;r5]C(=O)C=C". But arranged in a ring. Let me construct the SMARTS properly. The ring should have five atoms. The oxygen is at position 1, followed by a carbonyl (C=O) at position 2, then a double bond between positions 3 and 4. The exact SMARTS would be "O1C(=O)C=CC1". Let's test this.

But in the ring, the atoms are O, C(=O), C, C, C. Wait, no. The 2-furanone structure is a furan ring with a ketone. The positions are O at 1, C at 2 (with the carbonyl), then C=C at 3 and 4. So the SMARTS pattern would be "O1C(=O)C=CC1".

But this may not capture all substituted derivatives. For example, substituents on the ring carbons should be allowed. So the SMARTS could be "[O;r5]C(=O)[C;r5]=[C;r5][C;r5]". But how to ensure it's a five-membered ring with the correct arrangement.

Alternatively, using a SMARTS that matches the 2-furanone core, allowing substitutions. The key is the presence of the lactone (ester) group in a five-membered ring with the carbonyl adjacent to the oxygen and conjugated double bonds.

Another approach is to use two SMARTS patterns: one for the lactone (ester in a five-membered ring) and another for the conjugated system.

But perhaps the best way is to create a SMARTS pattern that specifically matches the 2-furanone structure. For example:

The core structure is a five-membered ring where the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), and there's a conjugated double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. The SMARTS could be "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1". This would match the 2-furanone skeleton. However, substituents can be present on any of the carbons except the oxygen and the carbonyl.

But in the examples given, some butenolides have substituents on the ring. For instance, "4-carboxymethyl-3-methylbut-2-en-1,4-olide" has substituents on the ring. The SMARTS should allow any substituents except breaking the core structure.

So using the SMARTS pattern "[O;r5]C(=O)C=C@1" (but proper syntax) to find the core. Wait, the correct SMARTS for the ring would be "[O;r5]1~C(=O)~C~C~C1", with a double bond between two of the carbons. Let's construct it properly.

The correct SMARTS would be: "[O]1:C:C(=O):C:C1", but ensuring it's a five-membered ring. Alternatively, "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1". Let me check if this works.

For example, the SMILES for 2-furanone is O=C1C=CC(O1). Wait, no. The actual structure is O=C1C=CC=C1. Wait, the correct SMILES for 2-furanone is O=C1C=CC=C1. But that's a five-membered ring with O at position 1, C=O at position 1, then C=C at positions 2-3 and 4-5? Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is O=C1CC=CC1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

2-furanone has the structure where the oxygen is at position 1, followed by a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. Then positions 3 and 4 are connected by a double bond, and position 5 connects back to the oxygen. So the ring is O-C(=O)-C=C-C-O, but that's six members. Wait, no, it's a five-membered ring. So the structure is O-C(=O)-C-C=C, forming a ring. Wait, perhaps the correct arrangement is O-C(=O)-C=C-C, making a five-membered ring. The SMILES would be O=C1C=CCC1. But in that case, the double bond is between C3 and C4 (positions 3 and 4 in the ring). The carbonyl is at position 2.

So the SMARTS pattern for this would be "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1". This should match any five-membered ring where the oxygen is followed by a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Testing this SMARTS on example butenolides:

Take "4-carboxymethyl-3-methylbut-2-en-1,4-olide" with SMILES CC1=CC(=O)OC1CC(O)=O. The ring is O1C(=O)C(C)=C(C(CC(=O)O))C. The SMARTS [O]1C(=O)C=CC1 would match the O-C(=O)-C=C part, even if there are substituents.

But wait, the SMILES is CC1=CC(=O)OC1CC(O)=O. The ring is O-C-C(=O)-C=C. So the ring is O-C(=O)-C=C-C, but the SMILES is written as O1C(=O)C(C)=C(C...). So the SMARTS should match that.

Therefore, using the SMARTS pattern "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1" would find the core structure. However, in some cases, the double bond might be in a different position, but according to the class definition, it's the 2-furanone skeleton, which implies the carbonyl is at position 2 adjacent to the oxygen.

Another point: the previous code checked for any double bond in the ring, but the correct structure requires the double bond to be conjugated with the carbonyl. So the SMARTS should enforce that the carbonyl is adjacent to a double bond.

So the revised plan is:

1. Use a SMARTS pattern that matches the 2-furanone core: a five-membered ring with an oxygen atom, followed by a carbonyl group (C=O), and a conjugated double bond in the ring.

2. Ensure that the carbonyl is part of the ring and adjacent to the oxygen.

3. Check that the lactone (ester) group is present, meaning the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl via the ring.

Implementing this with a SMARTS pattern like "[O;r5]C(=O)C=C" within a five-membered ring.

Wait, the correct SMARTS would be "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1". Let's test this on some examples.

For "4-carboxymethyl-3-methylbut-2-en-1,4-olide" (SMILES: CC1=CC(=O)OC1CC(O)=O), the ring is O1C(=O)C(C)=C(C)CC(O)=O. Wait, the ring is O-C(=O)-C(C)-C(CC(O)=O)-C. Hmm, maybe the SMILES is CC1=CC(=O)OC1CC(O)=O. Breaking it down: the ring is O-C-C(=O)-C=C-C. So the SMARTS [O]1C(=O)C=CC1 would match O-C(=O)-C=C-C, which is part of the ring here. So the SMARTS should match.

Another example: "Viridicatic acid" (SMILES: O=C1O[C@@H](CC(=O)O)C(=C1C(=O)CCCCC)O). The ring is O-C-O-C(=O)-C(=C)... Wait, maybe the ring is O-C(=O)-C(=C)-O-C. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the SMILES is O=C1O[C@@H](...)C(=C1...). The ring is formed by O-C(=O)-O-...? No, the ring is O=C1-O-[...]-C(=C1)... So the ring is O=C1-O-C(...)-C(=C)-1. That's a five-membered ring: O=C-O-C-C(=C)-O? Wait, perhaps the ring is O1=C-O-C-C(=C)-1. So the SMARTS [O]1C(=O)C=CC1 may not match because the carbonyl is part of the ring but the double bond is between different positions. So maybe the SMARTS needs to be adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMARTS is "[O]1C(=O)C=*C1", allowing any atoms in between as long as there's a conjugated system. Hmm, maybe using a more flexible SMARTS that checks for the presence of the carbonyl in the ring and a conjugated double bond adjacent to it.

Alternatively, using two separate checks: first, find a five-membered lactone (ester in a five-membered ring), then check that there's a conjugated carbonyl and double bond in the ring.

But constructing the correct SMARTS is tricky. Another approach is to look for the presence of the 2-furanone substructure using SMARTS.

The 2-furanone can be represented as a five-membered ring with the following arrangement: O-C(=O)-C=C. So the SMARTS pattern could be "[O]1:C:C(=O):C:C1", but ensuring it's a ring. Alternatively, "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1".

Testing this in RDKit:

For a simple 2-furanone (O=C1C=CC=C1), the SMARTS "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1" would match. For the example "4-carboxymethyl-3-methylbut-2-en-1,4-olide", the ring is O-C(=O)-C=C with substituents, so the SMARTS should match.

Another example: "Xerulin" (SMILES: O=C1OC(=CC=CC=CC=CC#CC#CC=CC)C=C1). The ring is O-C(=O)-C-C=C, which fits the SMARTS.

Thus, using this SMARTS pattern should correctly identify the core structure. Additionally, we need to ensure that the molecule is a lactone (cyclic ester), which means that the oxygen in the ring is connected to a carbonyl group. The SMARTS pattern should already account for this because it includes the O and the C(=O) in the ring.

So the revised code would:

1. Use the SMARTS pattern for the 2-furanone core.
2. Check if the molecule contains this substructure.
3. Additionally, ensure that the ring is part of a lactone (but the SMARTS may already enforce this).

Another possible improvement: the previous code checked for any five-membered ring with an oxygen and carbonyl, but didn't enforce the specific arrangement. By using a precise SMARTS, we can reduce false positives.

Now, considering false negatives like "dihydroouabain", which has the SMILES including [H] and possibly a saturated ring. Wait, but if the ring is saturated (no double bond), then it wouldn't be a butenolide. However, the example given in the false negatives might have a mistake. For instance, "dihydroouabain" might have a single bond where a double bond should be, making it not a butenolide. But according to the error message, it's a false negative, implying it should be a butenolide. Maybe the SMILES provided for dihydroouabain actually has the required structure. Alternatively, the previous code missed it because the conjugated double bond check was too strict.

Alternatively, the code might have failed to parse the SMILES correctly due to the explicit hydrogen notation. But RDKit's MolFromSmiles should handle that.

In any case, using the SMARTS pattern should capture the correct structures. The previous code's approach of iterating through rings and checking conditions may have missed some cases due to incorrect ordering or substituents.

Thus, the improved code should use a SMARTS pattern to directly match the 2-furanone core, allowing for any substituents as long as the core is present.

So the final code would:

- Use a SMARTS pattern like "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1" to find the 2-furanone core.
- Check if the molecule has this substructure.
- Return True if found, with the appropriate reason.

Additionally, to ensure it's a lactone (cyclic ester), the SMARTS should include the ester oxygen. But the SMARTS pattern "[O]1C(=O)C=CC1" already includes the oxygen in the ring connected to the carbonyl, which is part of the lactone structure.

Testing this approach should reduce false positives and false negatives by precisely targeting the required substructure.
