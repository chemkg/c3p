"""
Classifies: CHEBI:67142 nucleobase analogue

</think>

Okay, let's figure out why the previous code had so many false positives and negatives. 

Looking at the false negatives first: many examples like 8-hydroxyadenine and 5-formyluracil were missed because the core patterns didn't match. The original SMARTS patterns for the natural nucleobases might be too strict. For example, adenine's pattern was "[NH2]C1=NC=NC2=C1N=CN2", which might not account for different tautomers or substitutions. So the core detection is failing for valid analogues because the base structure isn't recognized.

For false positives, molecules like GTP or GDP were incorrectly classified. The code checked for any modification outside the core, but these nucleotides have the natural nucleobase attached to a sugar and phosphate. The current approach flags any substituent as a modification, but in reality, analogues should have modifications to the base itself, not just being part of a larger structure like a nucleotide.

So the main issues are:
1. Core patterns are too specific, missing modified bases.
2. Modifications are detected by any atoms outside the core, leading to false positives for nucleotides.
3. The approach to check for modifications is flawed because it counts any substituent (like ribose in GTP) as a modification, but those are part of the natural nucleotide structure, not the base analogue.

To fix this:
- Use more general SMARTS patterns for the nucleobase cores that allow for common substitutions. For example, adenine's core could be a purine ring system with certain nitrogens.
- Instead of checking for any atoms outside the core, look for modifications directly on the core atoms. For example, substitutions on the ring atoms or changes in functional groups.
- Exclude molecules where the nucleobase is part of a nucleotide (attached to a sugar or phosphate) unless the base itself is modified.

New approach steps:
1. Define relaxed core patterns that match the basic ring systems of nucleobases, allowing for some substitutions.
2. Check for modifications on the core atoms (like added groups or changed substituents).
3. Ensure that the molecule isn't a nucleotide (has no sugar/phosphate groups attached to the core).
4. Exclude exact natural bases by SMILES comparison.

Let's adjust the code accordingly.
