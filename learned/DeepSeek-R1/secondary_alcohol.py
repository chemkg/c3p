Classifies: CHEBI:35681 secondary alcohol

</think>

Okay, let's see why the previous code had a low F1 score. The main issues were false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false positives: Some molecules were incorrectly classified as secondary alcohols. For example, Diolmycin A1 has hydroxyls on secondary carbons but maybe other structures that shouldn't count. Wait, no, the definition is just about the hydroxyl being on a secondary carbon. So why were these false positives? Maybe the code considered hydroxyls attached to carbons that are part of rings or other structures where the carbon isn't actually a secondary one. Wait, maybe the code's check for SP3 hybridization was too strict or not strict enough. For example, if the carbon is in a ring but still has two other carbons attached, it's still secondary. Or maybe some hydroxyls were attached to carbons that are part of conjugated systems, making the hybridization different.

Looking at the false negatives: Some true secondary alcohols were missed. For instance, (-)-3,4-dimethoxy-3,4-desmethylenedioxycubebin was missed. The code checks for SP3 hybridization. Maybe the carbon in question isn't SP3? Like maybe it's in a ring with some conjugation, leading to a different hybridization. But according to the definition, the carbon just needs to be saturated (single bonds) and have two other carbons. So the SP3 check might be excluding valid cases.

Wait, the definition says "saturated carbon atom which has two other carbon atoms attached to it". Saturated here means the carbon has only single bonds. So hybridization might not be the right approach. Because even in rings, a carbon with single bonds would be SP3. But if the carbon is part of a double bond (like in an enol), it's not saturated. So maybe the code should check for the carbon being in a single bond (no double or triple bonds) rather than relying on hybridization. Because sometimes the RDKit's hybridization assignment might not be accurate, especially in complex ring systems.

Another problem: the code checks if the carbon has exactly two carbon neighbors. But maybe in some cases, the carbon has more than two neighbors, but two of them are carbons. Wait, noâ€”the definition says the carbon must have two other carbon atoms attached. So the carbon itself is bonded to two carbons (plus the hydroxyl and maybe another group). Wait, a secondary alcohol's carbon is connected to two other carbons. So the carbon with the hydroxyl must have exactly two carbons attached to it. Wait, no: the definition says "which has two other carbon atoms attached to it". So the carbon with the hydroxyl (the central carbon) is bonded to two other carbons. So the central carbon has three bonds: two to carbons, one to the hydroxyl. But wait, carbons can have four bonds. So maybe the central carbon has three other bonds: two to carbons and one to the hydroxyl, and the fourth bond could be to another hydrogen or another group. So the code's check for exactly two carbon neighbors might be incorrect. Wait, the definition says "two other carbon atoms attached to it". So the carbon with the hydroxyl (the -OH) must have two carbons attached to it. So that carbon has two carbon neighbors, plus the hydroxyl, and possibly another atom (like hydrogen). So in the code, when checking carbon_neighbors, it's looking for exactly two carbons. That part seems correct.

But maybe in some cases, the carbon has more than two carbons attached. For example, in a branched structure. Wait, no. The definition is clear: two other carbons. So the code's check for len(carbon_neighbors) == 2 is correct.

So why the false positives? Let's look at one example. Diolmycin A1 was a false positive. Its SMILES is OC1=CC=C(C[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)CC=2C3=C(C=CC=C3)NC2)C=C1. The hydroxyls are on secondary carbons. Wait, maybe the code is correct and the test case is wrong? Or perhaps the test case was mislabeled. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing some condition. For example, the carbon with the hydroxyl might be part of an aromatic ring. Wait, but the code checks for SP3 hybridization. If the carbon is in an aromatic ring (like phenol), it would have SP2 hybridization and be excluded. But in Diolmycin A1, the hydroxyls are on secondary carbons that are in non-aromatic positions. So why is it a false positive? Maybe the code is correct, but the test case is a false positive because the actual structure isn't a secondary alcohol. Or perhaps the test data is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing some other checks.

Alternatively, perhaps some of the false positives have hydroxyls attached to carbons that are adjacent to double bonds or other groups, making the carbon not truly saturated. For example, if the carbon is part of a conjugated system, even if it's SP3, maybe it's not considered saturated. Wait, the definition says "saturated carbon atom", which in chemistry means all single bonds. So the code's check for SP3 hybridization might not be sufficient. Because a carbon could be SP3 hybridized but have a double bond elsewhere in the molecule. Wait, no. The carbon itself must have only single bonds. So maybe the code should check that the carbon has no double bonds. So, the code checks for SP3 hybridization, but maybe that's not enough. For example, a carbon in a ring with a double bond elsewhere might still be SP3 but have a double bond in the ring. Wait, but the carbon in question would have single bonds. So the code's approach is correct in checking that the carbon is SP3 (which implies single bonds). So perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Looking at the false negatives: (-)-3,4-dimethoxy-3,4-desmethylenedioxycubebin was missed. Its SMILES is [H][C@@]1(COC(O)[C@]1([H])Cc1ccc2OCOc2c1)Cc1ccc(OC)c(OC)c1. The hydroxyl is attached to a carbon. Let's draw this. The hydroxyl is on a carbon that's part of a ring. Let's check the code's logic. The code checks for the carbon attached to the hydroxyl to have SP3 hybridization and exactly two carbon neighbors. If the carbon is in a ring and SP3, then it should pass. But maybe in this case, the carbon has three neighbors (like in a ring), so the code's check for exactly two carbon neighbors is failing. Wait, the carbon with the hydroxyl (O) is attached to two carbons (from the ring) and maybe another group. For example, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is attached to two adjacent carbons. But the hydroxyl's carbon would have two carbons (from the ring) plus the hydroxyl. So the code would check the carbon's neighbors. The code counts carbon neighbors (excluding the oxygen). So if the carbon is in a ring, it has two carbon neighbors (from the ring), so len(carbon_neighbors) would be 2. So why was this missed?

Wait, the code loops through all hydroxyl matches. For each hydroxyl oxygen, it checks the connected carbon. If any of them meet the conditions, it returns True. So in the case of (-)-3,4-dimethoxy..., the hydroxyl's carbon is in a ring. Let's see: the hydroxyl is attached to a carbon in the ring. The carbon is part of a ring, so its neighbors are two other carbons (ring atoms) plus the oxygen. So the code would count two carbon neighbors (the two in the ring), so len(carbon_neighbors) is 2. Then, if the carbon is SP3, it should return True. But in the previous code, this molecule was a false negative. So why?

Ah, maybe the carbon's hybridization is not SP3. Let's check. In a ring, especially a five-membered ring, the carbons can have different hybridization. For example, in a cyclopentane ring, carbons are SP3. But if the ring is part of a conjugated system, maybe the hybridization is different. Alternatively, perhaps the code's method of checking hybridization is incorrect. RDKit's hybridization assignment might not always be accurate, especially in complex ring systems. So relying on hybridization might be causing false negatives.

Alternative approach: Instead of checking hybridization, check if the carbon is in a double bond. Because a saturated carbon should not be part of any double or triple bonds. So the code should check that the carbon has no double bonds. So, for the carbon attached to the hydroxyl, check that it's not part of any double bond.

So, modifying the code: after finding the carbon, check if it's in a double bond. If it is, skip (since it's not saturated). Also, check that it has exactly two carbon neighbors. So:

carbon = neighbors[0]
if carbon.GetAtomicNum() != 6:
    continue
# Check if the carbon is part of any double bonds
if carbon.GetTotalDegree() != 4:  # not sure
# Or check if any bond is double
has_double = any(bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE for bond in carbon.GetBonds())
if has_double:
    continue

Wait, but a carbon can have a double bond and still have two other carbons attached. For example, if the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond but not part of it. Wait, no. The definition requires the carbon itself to be saturated (no double bonds). So the carbon with the hydroxyl must not have any double bonds. So the code should check that the carbon is not part of any double bonds.

So, modifying the code to check that the carbon has no double bonds. This would ensure it's saturated.

Additionally, the previous code checked for SP3 hybridization. But perhaps some carbons that are SP3 could still have double bonds (unlikely), or some carbons that are SP2 but in a single bond (like in a ring) could be considered. Wait, no. SP3 implies single bonds, SP2 implies double bonds. So the code's check for SP3 hybridization should suffice. But maybe RDKit assigns different hybridizations in some cases. For example, in small rings like cyclopropane, the hybridization might not be SP3. But in that case, the carbon isn't saturated. So maybe the SP3 check is correct.

But the false negatives suggest that some valid secondary alcohols are being missed because their carbons are not SP3. So perhaps the code should not check for SP3 hybridization but instead check that the carbon has no double bonds.

So, replacing the SP3 check with a check that the carbon has no double bonds.

Let's adjust the code:

Remove the check for SP3 hybridization, and instead check that the carbon is not part of any double bonds.

Another possible issue: the code returns True as soon as it finds any hydroxyl that meets the criteria. But maybe some molecules have multiple hydroxyls, some valid and some not. However, the function should return True if any hydroxyl is a secondary alcohol. So the code's approach is correct.

Another possible problem: in the code, when counting carbon neighbors, it excludes the oxygen. So the code checks for exactly two carbon neighbors. That's correct.

So, modifying the code to check for:

1. Hydroxyl group exists.
2. For each hydroxyl's carbon:
   a. Atomic number is 6.
   b. The carbon is not part of any double bonds (saturated).
   c. Has exactly two carbon neighbors.

Let's implement this.

Testing with the example that was a false negative: (-)-3,4-dimethoxy... The hydroxyl's carbon is in a ring. If the ring is all single bonds, then the carbon has no double bonds. So the code should detect it. If the code was checking for SP3 before, and the carbon in the ring is SP3, then why was it missed? Maybe the code's SP3 check failed. So replacing SP3 check with a check for no double bonds might fix this.

In the previous code, the carbon's hybridization was checked. If the carbon is in a ring and RDKit assigns a different hybridization (like SP2 for some reason), then the code would skip it. By removing the SP3 check and checking for no double bonds, we can include such cases.

So the revised code would:

For each hydroxyl group:

- Find the attached carbon.
- Check if the carbon is part of any double bond. If yes, skip.
- Check if the carbon has exactly two carbon neighbors. If yes, return True.

This approach should capture more cases where the carbon is saturated (no double bonds) even if hybridization is not SP3.

Testing the false positive case: Diolmycin A1. If the hydroxyl's carbon is part of a double bond, then it would be excluded. If not, then it's a valid secondary alcohol. But according to the test case, it's a false positive, so perhaps the code incorrectly included it. But according to the SMILES, the hydroxyls are attached to carbons in a non-aromatic ring. So maybe those carbons are saturated (no double bonds), and have two carbon neighbors. So according to the definition, they are secondary alcohols. But the test case says it's a false positive, which suggests that maybe the test case is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the code needs additional checks, like ensuring the carbon is not in a conjugated system or other structural features.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should also check that the carbon is not part of an aromatic ring. But secondary alcohols can be in non-aromatic rings. So that's not the issue.

In conclusion, the main issues in the previous code were:

1. Reliance on SP3 hybridization, which may not always be correctly assigned, leading to false negatives.
2. Not checking if the carbon is part of a double bond, leading to false positives if a hydroxyl is attached to a carbon with two carbons but in a double bond.

The revised code should check for:

- The hydroxyl's carbon has exactly two carbon neighbors.
- The carbon is not part of any double bonds (saturated).

By replacing the SP3 check with a check for no double bonds, the code should better capture the definition.

Now, implementing this in code:

For each hydroxyl oxygen:

- Get the connected carbon.
- Check if carbon has atomic number 6.
- Check that the carbon is not in any double bonds.
- Check that it has exactly two carbon neighbors.

This should address the false negatives and false positives.

Another possible issue: the code returns on the first valid hydroxyl. But some molecules might have multiple hydroxyls, and the code should return True if any of them is a secondary alcohol. The code does this correctly.

Testing the false positive cases: For example, 2-hydroxygondoic acid (SMILES: C(=O)(C(CCCCCCCC/C=C\CCCCCCCC)O)O). The hydroxyl is on a carbon that has a double bond elsewhere. Wait, the carbon with the hydroxyl has a double bond in the chain, but is the carbon itself part of a double bond? The SMILES is C(=O)(C(...)O)O. The hydroxyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)). So the carbon with the hydroxyl is adjacent to a carbonyl, but itself is not part of a double bond. So the code would check if that carbon has any double bonds. Since it doesn't, and if it has two carbon neighbors, then it would be considered a secondary alcohol. But according to the test case, this is a false positive. So why?

Looking at the structure of 2-hydroxygondoic acid: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. The carbon chain is long. The hydroxyl's carbon (C2) is connected to C1 (which is part of the carboxylic acid group) and C3 (a long chain). So the hydroxyl's carbon (C2) has two carbon neighbors (C1 and C3). So according to the code, this is a secondary alcohol. But according to the test case, it's a false positive. Wait, but according to the definition, it is a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the test case is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing something else.

But according to the problem statement, the false positives are cases where the code incorrectly classified them as secondary alcohols. So the code's previous approach had errors. Maybe the definition requires that the two other carbons are directly bonded to the central carbon, but in some cases, the code counts carbons that are part of a larger structure. But according to the SMILES, in 2-hydroxygondoic acid, the hydroxyl is on C2, which is bonded to C1 (carboxylic acid) and C3 (a CH2 group). So C2 has two carbon neighbors. So according to the definition, it is a secondary alcohol. But the test case says it's a false positive. This suggests that the test case may have an error, or perhaps the definition is different. Alternatively, maybe the code needs to check for the environment of the carbon (like being in a certain functional group).

Alternatively, perhaps the code should exclude cases where the hydroxyl is part of a carboxylic acid or other acidic group. But the definition doesn't mention that. So unless the problem's definition of secondary alcohol excludes such cases, the code is correct.

This suggests that there may be discrepancies in the test cases. However, given the problem's constraints, the code must adhere to the provided definition.

To address the false positives, perhaps the code should ensure that the hydroxyl is not part of a carboxylic acid or other group. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. So the code should not include such checks unless specified.

In conclusion, the main changes needed are:

1. Replace SP3 check with a check that the carbon is not part of any double bonds.
2. Ensure that the carbon has exactly two carbon neighbors.

This should improve the accuracy.
