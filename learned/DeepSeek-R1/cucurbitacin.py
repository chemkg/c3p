Okay, let's figure out why the previous code for classifying cucurbitacins had a low F1 score. From the error report, there were both false positives and false negatives. 

First, looking at the false positives: The code incorrectly classified some non-cucurbitacins. The main culprit might be the check for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). The SMARTS pattern "C=C(O)C(=O)" might be too simplistic. Some false positives might have structures that match this pattern but aren't cucurbitacins. Also, the check for tetracyclic systems using SSSR might not be accurate enough. Some molecules might have four rings but not the specific tetracyclic arrangement of cucurbitacins.

Now, the false negatives: Many true cucurbitacins were missed because the enone pattern wasn't detected. The existing SMARTS pattern might not account for variations in substitution or ring positions. For example, the enone might be part of a ring or have different substituents. Also, some cucurbitacins might have the enone in a different position or with different groups attached, which the current pattern doesn't catch.

Another issue could be the molecular weight and carbon count thresholds. The previous code required at least 25 carbons, but maybe some valid cucurbitacins have fewer due to substitutions. Similarly, the oxygen count check might be too strict if some compounds have fewer oxygens but still fit the class.

To improve, I need to refine the enone detection. Maybe use a more flexible SMARTS pattern that accounts for different environments, like being in a ring or having varying substituents. Also, checking for the cucurbitane skeleton specifically using a more precise substructure pattern would help. The previous code relied on SSSR rings, which might not capture the correct tetracyclic structure. Using a SMARTS pattern that matches the cucurbitane core could be better.

Additionally, the molecular weight and carbon checks might need adjustment. Perhaps lower the thresholds slightly or remove them if they're excluding valid cases. Also, considering glycosides (like the examples with glucosides) might require checking for sugar moieties, but since cucurbitacins can be glycosylated, the core structure should still be present.

So, the plan is:
1. Replace the enone SMARTS with a more comprehensive one that allows for ring systems and different substituents.
2. Use a specific cucurbitane core SMARTS pattern to ensure the correct tetracyclic structure.
3. Adjust or remove some of the less reliable checks like carbon count and molecular weight.
4. Keep oxygen checks but maybe lower the threshold if needed.

Testing these changes should reduce false positives by ensuring the core structure is present and improve true positives by better detecting the enone and core.
