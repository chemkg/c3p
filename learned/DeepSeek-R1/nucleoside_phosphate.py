</think>

Okay, let's figure out why the previous code had issues. From the error message, the main problems were false positives and false negatives. 

First, looking at the false negatives: some valid examples like UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl... were missed because the code didn't detect the nucleobase. The original code used SMARTS patterns for purine and pyrimidine bases. But maybe those patterns are too strict. For example, the purine pattern was looking for a specific arrangement of nitrogens and carbons in a ring, but some valid nucleobases might have substituents or different structures. Also, some examples like NMN(+) have a nicotinamide group instead of a traditional purine/pyrimidine, so the base detection needs to be broader.

Then, the false positives: some molecules were incorrectly classified because they had a phosphate attached to something else, not a nucleoside. The previous code checked for a sugar and a phosphate attached to it, but maybe the phosphate was part of a different group, not the nucleoside. So, the code needs to ensure that the phosphate is directly connected to the sugar in the nucleoside structure.

Another issue could be the sugar pattern. The original code used a specific ribose-like structure, but some nucleoside phosphates might have deoxyribose or modified sugars. The sugar pattern might be too strict, leading to false negatives.

So, here's what to improve:

1. **Nucleobase Detection**: Use a more flexible approach to detect nucleobases. Instead of relying on specific ring patterns, check for common heterocyclic atoms (like nitrogens in rings) that are characteristic of nucleobases. Alternatively, use a substructure search that includes both purines, pyrimidines, and other possible bases like nicotinamide.

2. **Phosphate Attachment**: Ensure that the phosphate is directly connected to the sugar moiety. The previous code checked for any sugar oxygen connected to phosphorus, but maybe there's a need to check for the ester linkage (O-P-O) specifically attached to the sugar's hydroxyl group.

3. **Sugar Detection**: Use a more general sugar pattern that allows for variations like deoxyribose or other modifications. Maybe look for a five-membered ring (furanose) with oxygen and carbons, but not enforce all hydroxyl groups.

4. **Check Connectivity**: Make sure the nucleobase is attached to the sugar (like the anomeric carbon) and the phosphate is on the sugar's hydroxyl. This would require checking the connectivity between the base, sugar, and phosphate.

Let me adjust the code accordingly. For the nucleobase, I'll use a more generic pattern that looks for rings with at least two nitrogens, which covers purines, pyrimidines, and similar structures. Also, check if the base is connected to the sugar's anomeric carbon. For the phosphate, ensure it's ester-linked to the sugar's hydroxyl. Also, handle cases where the phosphate might be part of a diphosphate or triphosphate group.

Testing this approach should reduce false negatives by accepting more nucleobase types and ensure the phosphate is correctly attached, reducing false positives.
