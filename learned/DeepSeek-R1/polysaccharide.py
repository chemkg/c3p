Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work. The main issue seems to be that all the test cases were missed, with the reason being "Insufficient glycosidic bonds". Let me look at the code and the examples.

First, the code counts sugar units by looking for 5 or 6-membered rings with oxygen and multiple hydroxyl groups. That part might be okay, but maybe the criteria are too strict. Then, it checks for glycosidic bonds as single bonds between two oxygen atoms connecting different rings. Wait, glycosidic bonds are typically between a sugar's anomeric oxygen (like O in a ring) and another sugar's oxygen. But in the code, they're checking for bonds between two oxygen atoms. That's not right. Glycosidic bonds are usually C-O-C, where the oxygen is part of the bridge between two sugar units. So the code's current approach would miss those because it's looking for O-O bonds, which don't exist in glycosidic linkages. That's a big mistake!

So the glycosidic bond detection is completely wrong. The code should look for oxygen atoms that are connected to two carbons (like ether linkages) and are part of connecting two rings. For each oxygen in a glycosidic bond, it's bonded to one carbon from each sugar ring. So the code needs to find oxygen atoms that are bridges between two rings.

Let me adjust that part. Instead of checking for bonds between two oxygen atoms, I should check for oxygen atoms that are connected to two carbons from different rings. So iterate over all oxygen atoms, check if they are in a bridge between two rings. Then count those as glycosidic bonds.

Also, the initial sugar unit detection might not be accurate. Maybe the criteria for identifying a sugar ring are too strict. For example, the code checks for at least three oxygen-containing groups, but some monosaccharides might have fewer. Or maybe the way oxygen is counted is off. For example, the ring oxygen is counted once, and then adjacent hydroxyl groups. But perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted.

Another thing: the molecular weight threshold was set to 1500, but some polysaccharides might be smaller. However, the definition says more than 10 residues. A single monosaccharide like glucose is around 180 g/mol. Ten would be 1800, so maybe the threshold should be higher. Wait, the code uses 1500, which might be too low. But the test cases include structures with many units, so maybe the threshold isn't the main issue here.

So the main problem is the glycosidic bond detection. Let's fix that. Also, the code counts glycosidic bonds as O-O bonds, which is incorrect. Need to find oxygen atoms that are part of the bridge between two rings.

Here's the plan:

1. Correct the glycosidic bond detection. For each oxygen atom, check if it's connected to two carbons that are in different rings. Each such oxygen is a glycosidic bond.

2. Revise the sugar unit detection. Maybe use a SMARTS pattern to identify typical sugar rings (like pyranose or furanose rings with multiple hydroxyls).

3. Adjust the thresholds. For example, require at least 11 sugar units (since definition is >10), and glycosidic bonds should be at least sugar_units - 1.

So, first, create a SMARTS pattern for sugar rings. Pyranose (6-membered with 5 carbons and 1 oxygen) or furanose (5-membered with 4 carbons and 1 oxygen). Then check for hydroxyl groups attached.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern like [C5,C6]O rings with multiple -OH groups.

But maybe using SMARTS is better. For example, a pyranose ring could be matched with a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen and multiple hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, use a more flexible approach. Let's try using SMARTS patterns to find possible sugar rings.

For example, a pyranose ring could be something like:

[*r6]@;!-[O;R] (but not sure). Alternatively, look for rings with 5 or 6 atoms where one is an oxygen and there are multiple -OH groups attached.

But perhaps using a SMARTS pattern like:

Pyranose: C1C(O)C(O)CC(O)O1 (but this is too specific). Maybe a more general pattern.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches any 5 or 6-membered ring with at least one oxygen in the ring and at least two oxygen atoms (including substituents).

Wait, the original code tried to count oxygen atoms in the ring and adjacent. Maybe the sugar unit detection is okay, but the glycosidic bond detection is the main issue.

So, revising the glycosidic bond part:

Loop through each oxygen atom in the molecule. For each oxygen, check if it's connected to two carbons, each in different rings. If so, count that as a glycosidic bond.

So, code steps:

- For each oxygen atom in the molecule:
   - If it has exactly two neighbors (since it's in a bridge)
   - Both neighbors are carbons
   - Each neighbor is part of a different ring

Then, each such oxygen is a glycosidic bond.

This approach would correctly count the glycosidic linkages.

Now, implement that.

Also, adjust the sugar unit detection. Maybe use a SMARTS pattern to find rings that are likely sugar units. For example, look for rings with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, use the existing approach but adjust the oxygen count. The original code counts oxygen in the ring and adjacent, but maybe the threshold of 3 is too high. For example, a glucose unit has 5 hydroxyls (including the ring oxygen?), maybe not. Let me think: glucose in pyranose form has 5 hydroxyls (positions 2,3,4,6, and the ring oxygen is at position 5). Wait, no. The ring oxygen is part of the ring (like in cyclic hemiacetal). So for glucose, the hydroxyls are on C2, C3, C4, C6, and the anomeric C1 (but in the ring, that's connected to the oxygen). So maybe each sugar unit has multiple hydroxyls.

But perhaps the original code's method for counting sugar units is not accurate enough. Using SMARTS might be better.

So, create a SMARTS pattern for a sugar ring. For example, a six-membered ring with an oxygen and at least three hydroxyl groups attached.

The SMARTS could be something like:

[$([O]1@C@C@C@C@C1), $([O]1@C@C@C@C@C@C1)] with multiple -OH groups.

But constructing that might be complex. Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that matches any 5 or 6-membered ring with at least three oxygen atoms (including the ring oxygen and substituents).

Alternatively, use the following approach:

Find all rings of size 5 or 6 that contain an oxygen atom. Then, for each such ring, check if there are at least two oxygen atoms (as substituents, like hydroxyl groups).

But maybe the original code's approach was okay, but the thresholds were off. Let's see: in the previous code, for each ring, it counts the ring oxygen and any adjacent oxygens (like hydroxyls). The threshold was o_count >=3. For a glucose unit, the ring oxygen plus hydroxyls would be 1 (ring O) + 4 (OH groups) = 5, which meets the threshold. But if a sugar has fewer OH groups (like deoxy sugars), this might fail. However, polysaccharides are made of monosaccharides, which typically have multiple OH groups.

But maybe the code's method of counting o_count is incorrect. For example, in the code, for each atom in the ring, it checks if the atom is O (counts as 1), and then for each neighbor not in the ring, if they are O, adds to the count. But this could count ethers or other oxygen-containing groups. Alternatively, maybe it should count hydroxyl groups specifically.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern to find rings with multiple hydroxyl groups.

For example, a pattern like:

[O;R]-[C;R]-[C;R]-[C;R]-[C;R] (for furanose) or similar, but this might not be flexible enough.

Alternatively, use the following SMARTS to find sugar-like rings:

Ring of size 5 or 6 with at least one oxygen in the ring and at least two hydroxyl groups attached.

But constructing such a SMARTS is tricky. Maybe:

For a 6-membered ring with an oxygen and at least two -OH groups:

[O;R1][C;R1][C;R1][C;R1][C;R1][C;R1] and (at least two -OH attached to the ring carbons).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the original approach is better but needs adjustment.

Alternatively, use the RDKit's built-in function to find carbohydrate motifs. Wait, RDKit has some functionality for carbohydrates. For example, the rdMolDescriptors.GetCarbohydrateBonds function or similar. Let me check.

Looking up RDKit documentation: There's a module called rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors which has functions like CalcNumCarbohydrateBonds. Wait, maybe that's a way to get the number of glycosidic bonds.

Alternatively, the code could use the Murcko decomposition to find rings and then check for sugar-like structures.

But perhaps the original code's main issue is the glycosidic bond detection. Let's focus on fixing that.

So, in the revised code:

1. Correct glycosidic bond detection by looking for oxygen atoms that are bridges between two rings.

2. Improve sugar unit detection, possibly using SMARTS patterns.

3. Adjust thresholds.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, rewrite the glycosidic bond detection:

Instead of looking for O-O bonds, look for oxygen atoms connected to two carbons from different rings.

So:

glycosidic_bonds = 0
for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
    if atom.GetAtomicNum() != 8:  # Oxygen
        continue
    if atom.GetDegree() != 2:  # Must be connected to two atoms (bridge)
        continue
    neighbors = atom.GetNeighbors()
    # Check if both neighbors are carbons in different rings
    rings = mol.GetRingInfo().AtomRings()
    neighbor_rings = []
    for n in neighbors:
        n_rings = [r for r in rings if n.GetIdx() in r]
        if not n_rings:
            break  # Not part of any ring
        neighbor_rings.append(n_rings[0])  # Take the first ring each neighbor is in
    else:
        # Check if the two neighbors are in different rings
        if len(neighbor_rings) == 2 and neighbor_rings[0] != neighbor_rings[1]:
            glycosidic_bonds +=1

This would count each bridging oxygen as a glycosidic bond.

But wait, each glycosidic bond is a single oxygen connecting two rings. So this count should correspond to the number of glycosidic bonds.

Then, the code should check if the number of glycosidic bonds is at least (sugar_units - 1). For a linear polysaccharide with n units, there are n-1 bonds. But if it's branched, there could be more. So the code's previous check of glycosidic_bonds < sugar_units -1 is too strict for branched polysaccharides. However, since the definition says "linked glycosidically" without specifying linear vs branched, maybe the check should be glycosidic_bonds >= sugar_units -1. But if the code counts each bridge oxygen as a bond, then even in branched structures, the number would be higher. So perhaps the check should be glycosidic_bonds >= sugar_units -1.

But how to accurately count sugar_units? If the code uses the SMARTS approach to find all monosaccharide residues, then sugar_units would be the count of such residues.

Alternatively, using the previous method of counting rings that meet certain oxygen criteria.

But perhaps the original code's sugar_units count was incorrect. For example, in a polysaccharide, each monosaccharide is a ring, so the number of rings should correspond to the number of units. But in reality, some rings might be part of the same unit (e.g., in cyclic structures), but that's rare. So counting the number of sugar-like rings might be a reasonable approximation.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern to find all possible monosaccharide rings.

For example, a SMARTS pattern that matches a 5 or 6-membered ring with an oxygen and multiple hydroxyl groups.

The SMARTS could be:

// For furanose (5-membered ring with O and at least two OH groups)
$([#8]1-*@;!=*-*@;!=*-*@;!=*-*@;!=*-*1)(O)(O)

But constructing this is tricky. Alternatively, use a more general approach.

Another approach: Use the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (O attached to C in the ring).

For each ring of size 5 or 6 with at least one O in the ring, check if there are at least two -OH groups attached to the ring atoms.

But how to implement this?

In code:

for ring in rings:
    if len(ring) not in (5,6):
        continue
    has_ring_o = any(mol.GetAtomWithIdx(a).GetAtomicNum() == 8 for a in ring)
    if not has_ring_o:
        continue
    # Count hydroxyl groups attached to ring atoms
    oh_count = 0
    for a in ring:
        atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(a)
        for neighbor in atom.GetNeighbors():
            if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 8 and neighbor.GetDegree() == 1:  # -OH
                oh_count +=1
    if oh_count >= 2:  # At least two -OH groups
        sugar_units +=1

This might be more accurate, as it checks for hydroxyl groups specifically.

So combining these ideas:

1. Count sugar units as rings (5/6 members) with at least one ring O and two or more OH groups.

2. Count glycosidic bonds as oxygen atoms bridging two different rings.

3. Check that the number of glycosidic bonds is at least sugar_units - 1.

4. Ensure molecular weight is appropriate.

Now, let's adjust the code accordingly.

Another thing: the previous code had a molecular weight check of <1500, but a 10-unit glucose would be ~1620 (180*9 + 18 for water loss?), so maybe the threshold should be higher. But the definition requires >10 residues, so maybe 11 units. 11*162 = 1782, so set the threshold to 1500 might be too low. So adjust to 1800.

Putting it all together:

The revised code would:

- Use SMARTS to find sugar rings or implement the hydroxyl count.

- Correctly count glycosidic bonds as bridging oxygens.

- Adjust molecular weight threshold.

Testing this approach should correctly identify the glycosidic bonds in the example SMILES strings.

Another possible issue: some glycosidic bonds might be part of the same ring (e.g., in cyclic oligosaccharides), but that's less common. The code should still count them as long as the oxygen bridges two different rings.

Finally, test the revised code on the examples. For instance, in the provided SMILES, there are multiple rings connected by oxygen bridges. The code should count those correctly.

Thus, the key changes are:

1. Correct glycosidic bond detection by checking for bridging oxygens.

2. Improve sugar unit detection by checking for hydroxyl groups.

3. Adjust molecular weight threshold.

This should resolve the false negatives from the previous attempt.
