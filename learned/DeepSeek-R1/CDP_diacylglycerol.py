Okay, let's see why the previous code failed. The error message says there was a problem with Mol.HasSubstructMatch using a NoneType. That probably means one of the SMARTS patterns didn't compile correctly, resulting in a None instead of a valid query molecule.

Looking at the previous code's patterns:

1. The glycerol_backbone pattern: "[CH2]-[CH](-O-C(=O)-*)-[CH2]". Wait, the * in SMARTS is for any atom, but maybe the syntax is off. Also, the ester groups might not be properly attached. Maybe the SMARTS isn't correctly written for the glycerol backbone with two esters.

2. The diphosphate_pattern "P-O-P" might not account for possible charges or oxygen states. In the example SMILES, the phosphates are written as P(O)(=O)O, so the actual bridge might be O-P-O-P-O. The original pattern might miss that.

3. The cytosine_pattern "n1c(=O)nc(N)cc1" – looking at the example SMILES, the cytosine has a structure like n1ccc(N)nc1=O. The SMARTS might not match because the ring atoms are in a different order. Maybe the pattern should be "n1c(=O)nc(N)cc1" but the actual arrangement in the molecule might differ.

4. The ribose_pattern "[C@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O" – perhaps the stereochemistry is too strict. Some examples might have different configurations, or the CO (which is part of the phosphate linkage) might not be present as in the pattern.

5. The big cdp_pattern might be too rigid, especially with stereochemistry and exact connectivity. If any part of that SMARTS is invalid, the entire pattern becomes None, causing the error.

Let me adjust each part step by step:

- Fix glycerol_backbone: Maybe use "[CH2]-[CH](-OC(=O)-*)-[CH2]" without the extra hyphen. Also, ensure the ester groups are properly attached.

- Diphosphate should be O-P-O-P-O, so the pattern should be "P-O-P" but with possible oxygens around. Maybe "P-O-P-O" or account for double bonds.

- Cytosine pattern: The example SMILES has "n1ccc(N)nc1=O". So the correct SMARTS would be "n1c(=O)nc(N)cc1" but arranged as n1ccc(N)nc(=O)[nH]1? Maybe use "[nH]1c(=O)nccc1N" or similar.

- Ribose: The SMILES examples have "[C@H]1O[C@H](...)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O". Maybe relax stereochemistry checks by removing some chiral markers.

- The big connectivity pattern might be too complex. Maybe break it into parts instead of one large SMARTS.

Also, the initial code checked for exactly 2 ester groups, but some examples might have more if there are other ester-like groups. Need to ensure those two esters are specifically on the glycerol.

Let me rewrite the code with these considerations:

1. Fix SMARTS patterns to ensure they compile.
2. Check for cytosine via ring structure and substituents.
3. Verify diphosphate linkage properly.
4. Ensure glycerol has two ester groups attached.
5. Avoid overly strict stereochemistry unless necessary.
6. Check connectivity between glycerol, diphosphate, ribose, and cytosine in steps.

Testing the code with the example SMILES should help catch these issues. For instance, the previous code's cytosine pattern didn't match the example's "n1ccc(N)nc1=O", which is a 2'-deoxycytidine? Wait, no—the SMILES shows "n1ccc(N)nc1=O", which is cytosine with the carbonyl at position 2 and amine at position 4. The SMARTS "n1c(=O)nc(N)cc1" should match that. Wait, in the SMILES it's written as n1ccc(N)nc1=O. Let me draw that:

Positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (C with N), 5 (C with O), 6 (N). Wait, maybe the SMARTS needs to be adjusted. Let me check:

The SMILES is n1ccc(N)nc1=O. That's a six-membered ring? Wait, no, the 'n1ccc(N)nc1=O' would be a five-membered ring? Wait, no, the indices would be 0,1,2,3,4. Let me parse it correctly. Maybe the correct SMARTS for cytosine is "n1c(=O)[nH]c(N)cc1". But perhaps the previous pattern didn't account for hydrogen or the exact arrangement.

Alternatively, use a more general pattern for the cytosine base, like a six-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group.

Another approach: Check for the presence of a cytidine moiety, which includes the ribose connected to cytosine. But that's part of the CDP group.

Also, the diphosphate bridge in the examples is part of the CDP (cytidine diphosphate), which connects the glycerol to the ribose via two phosphate groups.

Perhaps the main issues are in the SMARTS patterns not matching due to incorrect structure or stereochemistry. Let's adjust them to be more accurate and ensure they compile correctly.
