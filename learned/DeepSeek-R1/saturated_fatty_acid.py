Classifies: CHEBI:26607 saturated fatty acid

</think>

Okay, I need to create a function called is_saturated_fatty_acid that checks if a given SMILES string represents a saturated fatty acid. Let's start by understanding what a saturated fatty acid is. From the definition, it's a fatty acid with no carbon-carbon multiple bonds. They have a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a long aliphatic chain, which can be branched or unbranched, but with all single bonds.

First, I need to parse the SMILES into a molecule using RDKit. If the SMILES is invalid, return False with an appropriate message.

Next, check for the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which in SMILES is usually represented as C(=O)OH. But sometimes, especially in SMILES strings, it might be written as OC(=O) or COOH. So I'll look for the substructure [CX3](=O)[OX2H1]. This should match the carboxylic acid group.

Once the carboxylic acid is confirmed, I need to ensure there are no double or triple bonds between carbons. That means the molecule should have no unsaturated bonds. So I'll check all the bonds in the molecule. If any bond is a double (BondType.DOUBLE) or triple (BondType.TRIPLE) bond between two carbon atoms, then it's not saturated.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group itself has a double bond (C=O). I need to exclude that from the check. So the plan is: iterate through all the bonds, and for any bond that is between two carbons, check if it's a single bond. If any such bond is double or triple, it's unsaturated.

Additionally, the aliphatic chain should be of sufficient length. Saturated fatty acids typically have at least 4 carbons (like butyric acid), but some definitions might require longer chains. Looking at the examples provided, valeric acid (CCCCC(O)=O) has 5 carbons. So maybe the chain needs to have at least 4 carbons, including the carboxylic acid carbon. Wait, the carboxylic acid is COOH, so the chain is the number of carbons in the longest carbon chain starting from the COOH group.

So after confirming the carboxylic acid group and the absence of unsaturated bonds (excluding the C=O in COOH), I need to check the length of the carbon chain.

How to find the longest carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid? The carboxylic acid is at one end. So perhaps the longest chain starting from the COOH carbon. Alternatively, the longest carbon chain in the molecule, but ensuring that the COOH is part of it.

Alternatively, maybe the total number of carbons in the molecule (excluding the carboxylic acid's oxygen and hydroxyl) should meet a minimum. For example, butyric acid (4 carbons) is CCCC(O)=O. The examples include propionic acid (CCC(O)=O, 3 carbons) but the user's examples list it as a valid example. Wait, looking at the examples given:

Examples include propionic acid (SMILES: CCC(O)=O), which has 3 carbons in the chain (including the COOH carbon). So the chain length can be as short as 3. So maybe no minimum length check is needed, as long as it's a carboxylic acid with all single bonds.

Wait, but the definition says "fatty acid", which typically refers to longer chains (like 12 or more carbons), but the examples include shorter ones like propionic (3), butyric (4), valeric (5), etc. So perhaps the term here is used more broadly, including short-chain saturated fatty acids. Therefore, the program shouldn't impose a minimum chain length, just check for the carboxylic acid group and absence of double/triple bonds (excluding the carbonyl).

So the steps are:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. Check for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
3. Check that all carbon-carbon bonds are single (excluding the carbonyl group in COOH).
4. Return True if both conditions are met.

Now, implementing this in RDKit.

First, the carboxylic acid group can be detected using a SMARTS pattern. The carboxylic acid is [CX3](=O)[OX2H1]. Let's use that.

Then, iterate through all the bonds in the molecule. For each bond, if both atoms are carbons and the bond is not a single bond, return False.

But wait, the carbonyl group (C=O) is part of the carboxylic acid. So in the carboxylic acid group, there is a double bond between C and O. We need to exclude that from the check. So when checking bonds, if the bond is between C and O, it's allowed to be double. But any C-C double or triple bond is invalid.

So the code steps:

- Convert SMILES to molecule.
- Check if molecule is valid.
- Check for carboxylic acid group using SMARTS.
- If no carboxylic acid, return False.
- Iterate over all bonds in the molecule:
  - If bond is between two carbons (both atoms are C):
    - If bond type is double or triple, return False.
- If all C-C bonds are single, return True.

Wait, but the carbonyl group (C=O) is part of the carboxylic acid. That's a C=O bond, which is allowed. The check for C-C bonds only. So the code should look for any C-C bonds that are not single.

So in code:

for bond in mol.GetBonds():
    begin_atom = bond.GetBeginAtom()
    end_atom = bond.GetEndAtom()
    if begin_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 and end_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
        if bond.GetBondType() not in [Chem.BondType.SINGLE]:
            return False, "Contains unsaturated C-C bonds"

But wait, what about rings? For example, cyclopropane would have single bonds but in a ring. But in the context of fatty acids, rings are uncommon. However, the definition doesn't exclude them as long as all C-C bonds are single. So even if there's a ring with all single bonds, it's still considered saturated.

So the code should check all C-C bonds, regardless of structure, and ensure they are single.

Now, testing this logic against the examples.

Take octanoic acid: SMILES CCCCCCCC(O)=O. The structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. All C-C bonds are single. The code should return True.

Another example: 3-methylhexadecenoic acid has a double bond (SMILES includes =), so the code would detect the C=C and return False.

But in the examples provided, all the SMILES given are for saturated ones. So the code should correctly identify them.

Potential issues:

- Handling different protonation states of the carboxylic acid (e.g., deprotonated as COO-). But SMILES strings usually represent the neutral form, so [OX2H1] should match the -OH group.

- Branched chains: The code allows branching as long as all C-C bonds are single. For example, isobutyric acid (CC(C)C(O)=O) has branching but no double bonds, so it should pass.

- Isotopes or deuterated compounds: The examples include tetradecanoic-d27 acid. RDKit should handle isotopes, as the atomic number is still carbon.

Now, let's code this.

The previous attempt had an error: the code block was not properly formatted. The user's previous code had incorrect indentation, leading to a syntax error. So the new code must ensure correct Python syntax, proper indentation, and correct use of RDKit functions.

So putting it all together:

The function is_saturated_fatty_acid will:

1. Parse the SMILES.
2. Check for carboxylic acid.
3. Check all C-C bonds are single.
4. Return True and a reason if both conditions are met.

Now, writing the code with these steps.
