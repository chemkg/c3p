"""
Classifies: CHEBI:64611 ether lipid

</think>

Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was low, so there were both false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false positives: some molecules were wrongly classified as ether lipids. For example, DG(14:0/20:4...) was a false positive. The code might have detected an ether linkage not attached to the glycerol, or maybe the alkyl chain check wasn't strict enough. The previous code checked for any C-C-C-C chain, which might be too generic. Also, the ether pattern [C][O][C] could match any ether, not just those connected to the glycerol.

For false negatives, some ether lipids were missed. For instance, PC(O-2:0/2:0) was missed because the code looked for a 4-carbon chain, but maybe the actual chain was shorter. The definition allows for "one or more" ether linkages, but the code required a 4-carbon chain. Also, some macrocyclic structures were missed because the code checks for a glycerol backbone in a specific way. Maybe the glycerol pattern [CH2]-[CH]-[CH2] was too strict and didn't account for modified backbones or stereochemistry.

So, to improve:

1. **Glycerol Backbone Check**: The initial pattern might be too strict. Using a SMARTS pattern that allows for any substitution on the central carbon (like oxygen attachments) but retains the three-carbon chain structure. Maybe something like [CH2X4]-[CHX4]-[CH2X4], which allows for bonds to other atoms (like O).

2. **Ether Linkage Detection**: The previous code checked for any ether connected to glycerol, but maybe the way it checked neighbors was flawed. Need to ensure that the ether oxygen is directly attached to the glycerol's carbons. Also, using a more specific SMARTS pattern that matches the glycerol-attached ether. For example, looking for O connected to a carbon that's part of the glycerol.

3. **Alkyl Chain Requirement**: The previous code required a 4-carbon chain, but some valid ether lipids might have shorter chains (like in PC(O-2:0/2:0)). However, according to the examples, most have longer chains. Maybe check for at least 4 carbons in the chain connected via ether. But wait, some examples like PC(O-2:0/2:0) have shorter chains. Hmm, but looking at the false negatives, that example was missed because the code required 4 carbons. So perhaps the alkyl chain check should be adjusted. Maybe the chain can be any length (since the definition says "alkyl chain", which can be short), but in practice, maybe the examples have longer chains. Need to check. The user's examples include PC(O-2:0/2:0) which has a 2-carbon chain. So the previous code's 4-carbon check caused a false negative here. Therefore, the alkyl chain check should be removed or adjusted to allow shorter chains.

4. **Differentiating Esters**: Ether lipids have ether linkages instead of esters. The code should check that there's at least one ether linkage and no ester in that position. Wait, noâ€”ether lipids can have both ester and ether linkages. The definition says "one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage". So other positions can have esters. So the code should not exclude esters but must have at least one ether attached to glycerol.

So steps to fix:

- Improve glycerol detection with a better SMARTS pattern.
- Correctly identify ether linkages attached to glycerol carbons.
- Remove the alkyl chain length check or make it more flexible.
- Ensure that at least one ether is connected to the glycerol.

Also, looking at the false positives like "2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine", which is a regular glycerophospholipid with ester bonds, but the code might have mistaken some other structure as an ether. Maybe because the code didn't check properly if the ether is actually linking an alkyl to glycerol.

Another issue: the previous code checked if either neighbor of the ether oxygen is in the glycerol. But in reality, the ether oxygen should be directly attached to a glycerol carbon. So the correct approach is to find ether groups where one side is a glycerol carbon and the other is an alkyl chain.

So, perhaps using a SMARTS pattern that matches the glycerol carbons with an ether oxygen. For example, the glycerol is C1-C2-C3, and the ether is C-O-C, where one C is part of the glycerol.

Let me design a SMARTS pattern for the glycerol with an ether. Maybe:

glycerol_ether = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4]-[CHX4](-[CH2X4])-O-[CX4]")

This would match a glycerol carbon (the central one) connected to an oxygen, which is connected to another carbon (the alkyl chain). But maybe better to check all three positions.

Alternatively, for any of the three glycerol carbons connected via an ether:

The glycerol backbone is three carbons. For each of these, check if they have an oxygen connected via an ether (i.e., O connected to another carbon). So a SMARTS pattern like:

([CH2X4](-O-[CX4])-[CHX4]-[CH2X4]) | ([CH2X4]-[CHX4](-O-[CX4])-[CH2X4]) | ([CH2X4]-[CHX4]-[CH2X4](-O-[CX4]))

But maybe that's too complex. Alternatively, find all ether oxygens and check if they are attached to any of the glycerol carbons.

So the revised plan:

1. Find the glycerol backbone using a more flexible SMARTS pattern.
2. Find all ether oxygens in the molecule.
3. Check if any of these ether oxygens are connected to a glycerol carbon on one side and an alkyl chain on the other.
4. Ensure that there's at least one such ether linkage.
5. Remove the alkyl chain length requirement, as even short chains (like methyl) could be valid (though examples might have longer chains, but the definition allows any alkyl).

Additionally, some false positives might have ester groups, but that's okay as long as there's at least one ether. The code should not penalize esters elsewhere.

Testing the examples:

For PC(O-2:0/2:0), the SMILES is P(OCC[N+](C)(C)C)(OC[C@H](OC(=O)C)COCC)([O-])=O. The glycerol has an ether (O connected to C in COCC). The previous code's alkyl check required 4 carbons, but COCC is O-C-C, which is a 2-carbon chain (ethyl). So the previous check for C-C-C-C would miss this. Hence, removing the alkyl chain length check would allow this to be detected.

For the macrocyclic archaeol, the SMILES has a complex structure where the ethers might not be attached to a traditional glycerol. The code's glycerol detection might fail here. The initial glycerol pattern [CH2]-[CH]-[CH2] might not match if the carbons are part of a larger ring. So using a more flexible glycerol pattern that allows any three carbons in a row with possible substitutions might help.

Another approach: instead of looking for a strict glycerol backbone, check for a central carbon connected to two other carbons (like the glycerol structure), allowing for substituents (like O links).

So, updating the glycerol SMARTS to something like [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4], which allows for any bonds (like O attachments) on the middle carbon.

Also, in the previous code, the check for ether attachment to glycerol was flawed. It checked if either neighbor of the oxygen was in the glycerol. But if the oxygen is between two glycerol carbons (unlikely), that's not an ether lipid. So instead, for each ether oxygen, check that one neighbor is a glycerol carbon and the other is a non-glycerol carbon (i.e., part of the alkyl chain).

Putting this all together:

- Use a better glycerol pattern.
- Find all ether oxygens.
- For each ether oxygen, check if exactly one neighbor is a glycerol carbon and the other is a non-glycerol carbon (alkyl).
- Ensure at least one such ether linkage exists.
- Remove the alkyl chain length check.

Also, in the false positives, some molecules had sulfonates or other groups that matched the ether pattern but weren't part of an alkyl chain. Maybe ensuring that the non-glycerol side of the ether is part of an alkyl chain (only carbons and hydrogens).

But how to check that? Maybe the non-glycerol side should be a carbon chain without other functional groups. However, that's complex. Alternatively, just checking that the oxygen is connected to a carbon that's part of an alkyl chain (i.e., not part of another functional group like ester, amide, etc.).

But this might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, accept any ether linkage to glycerol, regardless of the other side, as long as it's an alkyl (could be any carbon chain). However, the definition says "alkyl chain", which implies a hydrocarbon chain. So maybe the code should check that the other side of the ether is a hydrocarbon chain (no heteroatoms).

But how to implement that? For the carbon attached to the ether oxygen (non-glycerol side), check that all its descendants are carbons and hydrogens. That's complicated. Alternatively, just check that the chain has at least one carbon (since even a methyl group is an alkyl).

But given time constraints, perhaps the code can just check for the presence of at least one ether linkage attached to glycerol, without checking the nature of the alkyl chain beyond being a carbon group.

So, the revised code steps:

1. Find glycerol backbone with a more flexible SMARTS.
2. Check for ether linkages where one side is a glycerol carbon.
3. Ensure at least one such linkage exists.

Let's adjust the code accordingly.

Testing the previous code's glycerol pattern: [CH2]-[CH]-[CH2]. This might miss cases where the glycerol carbons have substituents (like O atoms). The new pattern [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4] allows for any bonds (including O) on the middle carbon.

Also, in the ether detection, the code looked for [C][O][C], which could be any ether. Then checked if either neighbor is in the glycerol. But perhaps a better approach is to create a SMARTS pattern that directly matches an ether oxygen connected to a glycerol carbon.

For example:

glycerol_ether_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4;!$(O)]-[OX2]-[CX4]")

But maybe better to split into two parts: first find the glycerol, then check each of its carbons for an ether.

Alternatively, create a SMARTS that matches any of the glycerol carbons connected via an ether oxygen to an alkyl chain.

But this could get complex. Let's try:

After finding the glycerol atoms, iterate through each atom in the glycerol. For each atom, check if it has an ether oxygen (O connected to two carbons). Then, check that one of those carbons is part of the glycerol and the other is not.

Wait, no. The ether oxygen is connected to two carbons. For it to be an ether linked to glycerol, one of those carbons must be in the glycerol, and the other must be an alkyl chain.

So, for each ether oxygen in the molecule:

- Get the two neighboring carbons.
- If exactly one of them is in the glycerol, then it's a valid ether linkage.

This is what the previous code tried, but perhaps it didn't correctly identify the glycerol atoms.

So, in the revised code:

- Use a better glycerol pattern to capture the backbone.
- For each ether oxygen, check if exactly one neighbor is in the glycerol.

Also, remove the alkyl chain length check.

Another issue: in the false negatives like PC(O-2:0/2:0), the alkyl chain is ethyl (COCC), which is two carbons. The previous code's alkyl check required four, hence it was missed. Removing that check would fix this.

Now, implementing these changes:

1. Update glycerol SMARTS to [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4].
2. Find all ether oxygens (O connected to two Cs).
3. For each ether oxygen, check if exactly one neighbor is in the glycerol.
4. Remove the alkyl chain length check.

Let's code this.

Also, the false negatives like macrocyclic archaeol might not have a traditional glycerol backbone. The code's glycerol pattern might not detect it. For example, if the glycerol is part of a larger ring, the SMARTS might not match. But according to the definition, ether lipids are similar in structure to glycerolipids, so they should have a glycerol-like backbone. If the macrocyclic structure doesn't have a three-carbon chain, it's not an ether lipid. But in the example given, the macrocyclic archaeol has a glycerol backbone but connected in a ring. The SMILES shows a complex structure with OCC[C@@H]... which might form part of a glycerol. However, the SMARTS pattern [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4] might not match if the carbons are in a different arrangement. In that case, the code would miss it, but according to the problem statement, the examples provided are valid, so perhaps the code needs to account for that. However, without a more flexible glycerol pattern, it's challenging. For now, proceed with the improved pattern and see.

Another possible improvement: use a more general glycerol pattern that allows any three contiguous carbons with hydroxyl or other groups. But this could lead to false positives. Alternatively, use the same approach as the triglyceride example, which used [CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4].

Testing the macrocyclic archaeol SMILES: the glycerol part might be OCC[C@@H]... but the three carbons might not be in a row. So the code's glycerol pattern might not find it. But according to the false negatives, it's a valid ether lipid. So the code's glycerol detection is failing here. How to adjust the pattern?

Wait, the macrocyclic archaeol's SMILES starts with [C@@H]1(OCC[C@@H]... which includes O-C-C-C. The glycerol backbone is O-C-C-C, but the three carbons are OCC. Maybe the glycerol is O-C-C-C, but the code's pattern is looking for three contiguous carbons. Alternatively, maybe the glycerol is part of a larger structure. Without the exact structure, it's hard to say, but the code's current approach might not capture all variations. However, given time constraints, proceed with the improved code and see.

In summary, the key fixes are:

- Better glycerol detection.
- Correctly identifying ethers attached to glycerol.
- Removing the alkyl chain length requirement.

Let's implement this.
