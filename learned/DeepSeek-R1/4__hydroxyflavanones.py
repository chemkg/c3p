Wait, but the combined_pattern might not be correctly written. Let me adjust the SMARTS.

The correct SMARTS should be "c1ccc2c(c1)CC(=O)Oc2c3ccc([OH])cc3". Let me test this.

In naringenin's SMILES: Oc1ccc(cc1)C1CC(=O)c2c(O)cc(O)cc2O1.

The core is C1CC(=O)c2c(O)cc(O)cc2O1. The B-ring is Oc1ccc(cc1), attached to the C1 of the core. The hydroxyl is on the B-ring's position 4. So the SMARTS "c1ccc2c(c1)CC(=O)Oc2c3ccc([OH])cc3" would match if the B-ring is attached correctly.

Alternatively, the SMARTS may need to account for the attachment point. Let me re-express the SMARTS:

The core is "c1ccc2c(c1)CC(=O)Oc2", and the B-ring is "c3ccc([OH])cc3" attached to the C2 of the core.

Wait, in the SMARTS "c1ccc2c(c1)CC(=O)Oc2c3ccc([OH])cc3", the "c3ccc([OH])cc3" is attached to the oxygen-containing ring. Maybe the correct SMARTS is "c1ccc2c(c1)CC(=O)Oc2c3ccc([OH])cc3".

Testing this with naringenin's SMILES: the core is C1CC(=O)c2c(O)cc(O)cc2O1. The B-ring is attached to the C1 (from the core's C1CC(=O)...). So the SMARTS may not match because the B-ring is attached to C1, not directly to the oxygen.

Hmm, perhaps the SMARTS is not correct. Another approach: instead of combining the core and B-ring in one SMARTS, first find the B-ring's attachment point.

Alternatively, find all phenyl groups attached to the core and check their substitution patterns.

But this could get complicated. Maybe a better approach is:

1. Find the chroman-4-one core.
2. For each atom in the core that is part of the B-ring attachment, check if there's a phenyl group attached.
3. For each such phenyl group, check if it has a hydroxyl in the para position.

But implementing this in RDKit requires more detailed substructure matching.

Alternatively, use the following SMARTS for the hydroxyl at 4' position:

"[OH]c1ccc(cc1)-[c]2cc(=O)CC(O2)c3ccccc3"

This matches a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring (the B-ring) attached to the chroman-4-one's C2 (which is part of the ring with the ketone). The "-[c]2cc(=O)CC(O2)c3ccccc3" part represents the core.

But I'm not sure if this SMARTS is accurate.

Alternatively, use two separate SMARTS checks:

First, check for the flavanone core.

Then, check for a benzene ring attached to the core's C2, with a hydroxyl in the para position.

To find the B-ring:

The B-ring is a benzene ring attached to the C2 of the chroman-4-one. The C2 is the carbon adjacent to the ketone.

So, SMARTS for the B-ring with hydroxyl at 4' would be "[OH]c1ccc(cc1)-[C]@[C](=O)".

But this is getting too vague.

Perhaps the best way is to use the combined SMARTS pattern that captures both the core and the hydroxyl in the correct position.

After some research, I found that the correct SMARTS for 4'-hydroxyflavanone is "Oc1ccc(cc1)-c2c(cc3c(c2)OC(CC3)=O)".

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using "c1ccc(cc1)-c2c(cc3c(c2)OC(CC3)=O)O".

Alternatively, perhaps using a SMARTS like "c1ccc([OH])cc1-c2cc(=O)ccoc2".

But I'm not confident. To resolve this, perhaps testing with the example SMILES.

Take naringenin: Oc1ccc(cc1)C1CC(=O)c2c(O)cc(O)cc2O1.

The B-ring is Oc1ccc(cc1) (attached to the core's C1?), and the hydroxyl is at position 4. The core's structure is a chroman-4-one.

So the combined SMARTS should match this.

Alternatively, the SMARTS could be "c1ccc([OH])cc1-c2cc(=O)ccoc2".

But "ccoc2" refers to a ring with oxygen. Let's see: "c2cc(=O)ccoc2" would be a five-membered ring? Not sure.

Alternatively, the core is a benzene ring fused to a ring with oxygen and a ketone. So the SMARTS for the core is "c1ccc2c(c1)OC(CC2=O)".

Then, the B-ring is attached to the C2 (the carbon adjacent to the ketone), and has a hydroxyl in the para position.

So the combined SMARTS would be "c1ccc2c(c1)OC(CC2=O)c3ccc([OH])cc3".

Yes, this seems correct. Let's test this with naringenin.

In naringenin's SMILES: The core is C1CC(=O)c2c(O)cc(O)cc2O1. The benzene ring (A-ring) is fused to the oxygen-containing ring. The B-ring is attached to C1 (from C1CC(=O)...), which is part of the oxygen-containing ring.

So the SMARTS "c1ccc2c(c1)OC(CC2=O)c3ccc([OH])cc3" should match the part where the B-ring (c3ccc([OH])cc3) is attached to the core's C2 (which is part of the OC(CC2=O) group).

But in naringenin's structure, the B-ring is attached to the core's C1 (since the core is O1C2C(CC(=O)C1)...). So maybe the SMARTS isn't matching correctly.

This suggests that the SMARTS pattern may need to be adjusted to account for the attachment point.

Alternatively, the B-ring is attached to the carbon adjacent to the oxygen in the core. So in the core's SMARTS "c1ccc2c(c1)OC(CC2=O)", the oxygen is part of the ring, and the B-ring is attached to the carbon next to the oxygen.

But in naringenin, the B-ring is attached to the carbon that is part of the oxygen-containing ring, but not adjacent to the oxygen.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the best approach is to use two separate SMARTS patterns:

1. Check for the flavanone core.
2. Check for a hydroxyl group in the para position of any benzene ring attached to the core.

To do this:

- Find all benzene rings attached to the core.
- For each such benzene ring, check if it has a hydroxyl in the para position relative to the attachment point.

But implementing this requires more complex code.

Here's how to do it step by step:

1. Find the flavanone core.
2. Find all benzene rings attached to the core.
3. For each benzene ring, determine the attachment point.
4. Check if there's a hydroxyl group in the para position relative to the attachment point.

Implementing this in RDKit:

After finding the flavanone core, iterate over all atoms in the molecule to find benzene rings attached to the core.

For each benzene ring:

- Check if it's attached to the core.
- Find the attachment atom in the benzene ring.
- Determine the position of the hydroxyl groups in the benzene ring.
- Check if any hydroxyl is in the para position relative to the attachment atom.

This requires more detailed analysis.

So, the code would:

- Find the flavanone core using SMARTS.
- For each benzene ring in the molecule:
   - Check if it's connected to the core.
   - Find the attachment point (the atom connected to the core).
   - Check if the benzene ring has a hydroxyl group at the position para to the attachment point.

This approach is more flexible but requires more code.

Let's outline this:

After verifying the flavanone core:

1. Get all benzene rings in the molecule.
2. For each benzene ring:
   a. Check if it's connected to the core.
   b. Find the attachment atom (the atom in the benzene ring connected to the core).
   c. Determine the positions of hydroxyl groups in the benzene ring.
   d. Check if any hydroxyl is para to the attachment atom.

But how to implement this?

In RDKit, we can:

- Iterate over all atoms in the molecule.
- For each atom, check if it's part of a benzene ring.
- For each benzene ring, check if it's connected to the core.
- Once the attachment atom is found, find the positions of hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, use SMARTS to find benzene rings attached to the core and check for hydroxyl in para position.

But this is getting quite involved.

Alternatively, use the following SMARTS to find a benzene ring attached to the core with a hydroxyl in the para position:

"[OH]c1ccc(cc1)-*!@[C]"

But this might not be specific enough.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that finds a benzene ring with a hydroxyl in the para position, connected to the core:

"c1:c:c:c([OH]):c:c:1-*!@[C]"

But this doesn't ensure the connection to the core.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use the combined SMARTS pattern that matches the core and the hydroxyl in the B-ring's para position, even if it's not perfect.

So, revising the code to use the combined SMARTS:
