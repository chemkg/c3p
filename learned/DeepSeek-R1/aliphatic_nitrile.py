Okay, let's figure out why the previous code failed. The main issue is that all the test cases were missed because the code didn't detect any nitrile groups. Looking at the previous code's nitrile pattern: [CX3]#[NX1]-[*]. Wait, maybe the SMARTS pattern is incorrect. Let me check.

The nitrile group is a carbon triple-bonded to nitrogen. The correct SMARTS for a nitrile should be [C]#[N]. The previous pattern [CX3] might be too restrictive. CX3 means a carbon with three bonds, but in a nitrile, the carbon is triple-bonded to N, so it has two bonds (since triple bonds count as one). Wait, RDKit's SMARTS handling might consider the valence. Let me think: the nitrile carbon has a triple bond to N and possibly another single bond. So the carbon in a nitrile (R-C#N) would have two bonds (the triple bond counts as one in SMARTS). So maybe the correct pattern is [C]#[N], not requiring the adjacent atom. The previous pattern included a third atom (adjacent), but maybe that's not necessary.

In the previous code, the nitrile_pattern was [CX3]#[NX1]-[*], which looks for a carbon with three connections (CX3) triple bonded to N (NX1) and connected to another atom. But in a nitrile group (C#N), the carbon is only bonded to the nitrogen and possibly one other group (like R-C#N). So the carbon would have two connections (the triple bond to N and one single bond to R). So CX2 might be more appropriate. But maybe the SMARTS pattern was incorrect, leading to no matches.

Let me test the SMARTS pattern. For acetonitrile (CC#N), the nitrile carbon is connected to the methyl group and triple bond. So the nitrile carbon has two single bonds (if considering valence, but SMARTS might count the triple bond as one bond). So the correct SMARTS for the nitrile group should be [C]#[N]. Let's adjust the pattern to [C]#[N], which matches any carbon triple bonded to nitrogen. Then, check if that carbon is part of an aromatic system.

Wait, but in aromatic nitriles (like benzonitrile), the nitrile is attached to an aromatic ring. The code should check that the carbon adjacent to the nitrile (the one attached to the nitrile carbon) is not aromatic. Wait, no: in benzonitrile, the nitrile is attached to a benzene ring. The nitrile carbon (C#N) is connected to an aromatic carbon. So the code needs to check that the carbon adjacent to the nitrile group (the R group) is not aromatic.

So the correct approach is: find all nitrile groups (C#N), then check the carbon attached to the nitrile carbon (the R group's carbon) to ensure it's not part of an aromatic ring.

So the steps should be:

1. Find all nitrile groups (C#N).
2. For each nitrile group, get the carbon attached to the nitrile carbon (the R group's carbon).
3. Check if that R carbon is aromatic. If any of them are aromatic, it's not aliphatic.

The previous code's SMARTS pattern was incorrect, leading to no matches. Let's adjust the SMARTS to [C]#[N]. Then, for each nitrile group, get the carbon adjacent to the nitrile carbon and check if it's in an aromatic ring.

So, the revised code would:

- Use the SMARTS pattern [C]#[N] to find all nitrile groups.
- For each nitrile group, get the nitrile carbon (C in C#N).
- Check the atoms bonded to this nitrile carbon. Each nitrile carbon should have one other bond (since triple bond to N is one bond, and one single bond to R). So the nitrile carbon's neighbors would be the R group's carbon and the nitrogen.
- For the R group's carbon (the one attached to the nitrile carbon), check if it's in an aromatic ring.

Wait, but in the nitrile group, the carbon (let's call it C1) is triple bonded to N. C1 is connected to another carbon (C2) from the R group. We need to check if C2 is part of an aromatic system.

So the code should:

1. Find all C#N groups.
2. For each C in C#N, check the neighboring atoms (excluding N) to find the R group's carbon.
3. Check if that R carbon is in an aromatic ring.

If any of those R carbons are aromatic, the molecule is not an aliphatic nitrile.

So, modifying the code:

- The nitrile_pattern should be [C]#[N].
- For each match (C and N), get the C atom.
- Check the neighbors of C (excluding N) to get the R group's carbon(s).
- For each R carbon, check if it's in an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the nitrile carbon (C) is connected to N via triple bond and to R via a single bond. So each nitrile carbon will have exactly one neighbor (the R carbon) besides N. So for each nitrile group, the R carbon is the only other neighbor.

So in code:

nitrile_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C]#[N]'))
if not nitrile_matches:
    return False, "No nitrile groups found"

for match in nitrile_matches:
    # match is (C_idx, N_idx)
    c_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(match[0])
    # Get neighbors of C that are not N
    r_carbons = [nbr for nbr in c_atom.GetNeighbors() if nbr.GetIdx() != match[1]]
    # Should have exactly one R carbon
    for r_carbon in r_carbons:
        if r_carbon.GetIsAromatic():
            return False, "Nitrile attached to aromatic carbon"

This approach should correctly identify nitrile groups and check their adjacent carbons for aromaticity.

In the previous code, the SMARTS pattern was incorrect, leading to no matches. Changing the pattern to [C]#[N] should fix that. Then, checking the adjacent R carbon's aromaticity.

Testing this with acetonitrile (CC#N), the nitrile C is connected to a methyl group. The R carbon (the methyl C) is not aromatic, so it should return True.

For benzonitrile (C1=CC=CC=C1C#N), the R carbon is part of the benzene ring (aromatic), so it returns False.

Now, applying this to the test cases that were missed:

Take beta-aminopropionitrile (NCCC#N). The nitrile group is present. The adjacent R carbon is part of an aliphatic chain. So the code should detect the nitrile and check the R carbon (the third C in CCC#N), which is aliphatic. Thus, returns True.

The previous code's SMARTS pattern didn't find nitrile groups because it was looking for [CX3]#[NX1]-[*], which may not match correctly. Using [C]#[N] should capture all nitrile groups.

So the corrected code should:

- Use the correct SMARTS pattern for nitrile groups.
- Check the adjacent R carbon for aromaticity.

Thus, the revised code should fix the false negatives.
