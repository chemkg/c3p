Okay, so I need to create a function called is_organofluorine_compound that checks if a given SMILES string represents an organofluorine compound. The definition says it's a compound with at least one carbon-fluorine bond. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in RDKit, I can parse the SMILES into a molecule object. Then, I need to check if there are any C-F bonds in the molecule. How do I do that?

Maybe I can iterate through all the atoms in the molecule. For each atom, if it's a carbon, check its neighboring atoms. If any neighbor is fluorine, then there's a C-F bond. Alternatively, I can use a SMARTS pattern to find such bonds.

Wait, SMARTS might be easier. The SMARTS for a carbon bonded to fluorine would be [C][F]. But I need to make sure that the bond is between carbon and fluorine. So the pattern would be [C]F. But maybe I should use a bond query to ensure they are actually bonded.

Alternatively, using GetSubstructMatches with the pattern [C]-F. Let me test that. So, create a substructure pattern where a carbon is bonded to a fluorine. If there's at least one match, then it's an organofluorine compound.

Also, I need to handle invalid SMILES. So first, parse the SMILES. If the molecule is None, return False and "Invalid SMILES".

Then, check for the presence of C-F bonds. If any, return True and the reason. Otherwise, False and the reason.

Wait, what about different bond types? Like double bonds? But fluorine typically forms single bonds. So maybe the SMARTS [C]-[F] is sufficient. Let's use that.

So the steps are:

1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule.
2. If invalid, return False.
3. Check if there's at least one C-F bond using SMARTS.
4. If yes, return True with the reason.
5. Else, return False.

Let me write the code accordingly. The function should be named is_organofluorine_compound, take a SMILES string, and return a boolean and a string.

Testing examples: For trifluoroacetic acid (OC(=O)C(F)(F)F), there are three C-F bonds. The code should detect that. For something without any C-F bonds, like benzene, it should return False.

Potential issues: Some molecules might have F attached to non-carbon atoms, like SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), which shouldn't count. The SMARTS [C]-F would ignore those because the F is bonded to S, not C.

Another edge case: a molecule with only CF3 groups. The code should catch that.

So the code would look something like:

Import RDKit modules, define the function, parse the SMILES, check for substructure matches of [C]-F, and return based on that.

Wait, the SMARTS pattern should be [C]-[F] or maybe [C][F]? Let me confirm. In SMARTS, a single bond is '-', but if unspecified, it's any bond. Since fluorine can only form single bonds, maybe [C]-[F] is better to be explicit.

Alternatively, just [C][F] would match any bond between C and F. But since F can't form double bonds, maybe it's safe to use [C][F].

Testing this pattern in RDKit should find all C-F bonds regardless of bond order (but fluorine only forms single bonds anyway).

So the code:

from rdkit import Chem

def is_organofluorine_compound(smiles: str):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if mol is None:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES"
    pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C][F]')
    if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
        return True, "Contains at least one carbon-fluorine bond"
    else:
        return False, "No carbon-fluorine bonds found"

Wait, but what about cases where the F is part of a larger group, like CF3? The pattern [C][F] would match each F attached to C. So even if one C has multiple Fs, as long as there's at least one, it's a match.

Yes, this should work. For example, in CF3, the C is bonded to three Fs. The pattern would match each C-F bond, so the molecule would have matches and return True.

Another example: 4-fluorobenzoate ([O-]C(=O)c1ccc(F)cc1). The F is attached to a carbon in the benzene ring. The pattern would find that.

So this code should correctly identify organofluorine compounds by checking for any C-F bonds. The previous error was probably due to incorrect code formatting or syntax, but the approach here seems solid.
