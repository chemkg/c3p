Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The main issues were false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false positives: Many were dipeptides or tripeptides like Phe-Gly, which have a peptide bond (N connected to CO) but aren't N-acylglycines. The original SMARTS pattern matched any structure where an acyl group is attached to an NH that's connected to CH2 and a carbonyl. But peptides also have this pattern. So the code wasn't distinguishing between acylation (single substituent on N) and peptide bonds (which have another substituent).

The false negatives were cases where the carboxylic acid might be esterified (like Mortivinacin B) or part of a more complex structure. The original code tried to check for ester variants, but maybe the pattern wasn't comprehensive enough.

To fix this, I need to adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the nitrogen in the acyl group has exactly one substituent (the acyl group) and only one hydrogen. That would exclude peptide bonds where the nitrogen is connected to another carbon (like in Phe-Gly, where the N is connected to both the acyl and the phenylalanine's carbon).

Also, the ester check might need to allow for different oxygen contexts. Maybe the carboxylic acid is part of an ester or other derivative, so the SMARTS should account for that.

Another thing to consider: The glycine part must have the CH2 between the N and the carboxylic acid. So the core structure is R-C(=O)-NH-CH2-C(=O)-O... but the O could be in different forms (acid, ester, salt, etc.).

So the revised approach would be:

1. Use a SMARTS pattern that ensures the nitrogen has exactly one acyl group and one hydrogen (to exclude peptides).
2. Check for both acid and ester forms of the carboxylic acid.
3. Maybe verify that there are no additional substituents on the nitrogen beyond the acyl group and hydrogen.

Let me adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly. The main pattern should be something like [CX3](=[OX1])-[NX3H1]-[CH2]-[CX3](=O)-[OX2H0,OX1-]. This would match the acylated nitrogen connected to CH2 and a carbonyl group that's either an ester (O with two bonds) or deprotonated acid. Also, the nitrogen must have only one substituent (the acyl) and one hydrogen.

Testing this against the false positives: For example, Phe-Gly has a structure where the nitrogen is connected to two carbons (the acyl and the phenylalanine's CH2), so the SMARTS pattern requiring [NX3H1] (only one substituent) would exclude it. Similarly, dipeptides would have the nitrogen bonded to two carbons, thus not matching the pattern.

For the false negatives, maybe the ester check wasn't capturing all variations. Including different oxygen states in the main pattern might help. Also, ensuring that the carboxylic acid part is properly accounted for in various forms (like ester, salt, etc.) could improve detection.

Another edge case: Some molecules might have the N-acylglycine part embedded in a larger structure, so the SMARTS should find any occurrence of the substructure anywhere in the molecule.

Putting this together, the revised code should have stricter SMARTS patterns to exclude peptides and capture all variants of the carboxylic acid/ester group. Let's implement that.
