</think>

Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The main issue was a low F1 score, meaning the model had both false positives and false negatives. Let's look at the examples.

First, the false positives. The previous code used the SMARTS pattern "[O]=C1NCC(=O)NC1", which is a six-membered ring with two ketones at positions 2 and 5. But some molecules that matched this pattern were not actual 2,5-diketopiperazines. For example, (3S,9aR)-3-benzyl-... has a piperazine-2,5-dione core but is part of a larger ring system (like a bicyclic structure), which might not be considered a simple diketopiperazine. The SMARTS pattern might be matching substructures within larger rings, leading to false positives.

Then, the false negatives. Some valid examples like neoechinulin B anion were missed. Looking at their SMILES, the core might have substituents or double bonds that the original SMARTS didn't account for. For instance, the original pattern expects single bonds between the nitrogen and carbons, but some structures might have double bonds or branches that break the strict pattern.

So, the problem is that the initial SMARTS was too rigid. It required exactly the sequence O=C1N-C-C(=O)-N-C1, but real molecules might have substitutions, different bond orders, or ring fusions that the pattern doesn't capture. For example, if there's a double bond in the ring (like in some of the examples), the original pattern wouldn't match. Also, substituents on the nitrogen or adjacent carbons might not be allowed in the original pattern.

To fix this, the SMARTS pattern needs to be more flexible. The core structure should be a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5, but allowing for variations in bond types and substituents. The ring atoms should be connected in the order O=C-N-...-C(=O)-N, but the exact bonds (single or double) might vary, and substituents could be present on the non-ketone carbons.

A better approach is to create a SMARTS pattern that matches the piperazine-2,5-dione skeleton regardless of bond order, as long as the two ketones are in the correct positions. Also, allowing for possible substituents on the nitrogen atoms or adjacent carbons. For example, using "O=C1NCC(=O)N1" but with possible aromatic bonds or substituents.

Wait, but the original SMARTS was "[O]=C1NCC(=O)NC1". Let's check: that's a six-membered ring where positions 1 and 4 are carbonyl groups (O=C and C=O). Wait, noâ€”positions 1 and 4? Let me draw it. The SMARTS is O=C1N-C-C(=O)-N-C1. So the ring is O=C-N-C-C(=O)-N-C (but arranged in a ring). So positions 1 (O=C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C=O), 5 (N), 6 (C). So the two ketones are at positions 1 and 4. Wait, that's not 2 and 5. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering.

Wait, the definition says piperazine-2,5-dione. Piperazine is a six-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 4. So a piperazine-2,5-dione would have ketones at positions 2 and 5. So the structure should be N1-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1. So the ring is N-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-N-C, forming a six-membered ring. The SMARTS should represent this arrangement.

But the original SMARTS was O=C1NCC(=O)NC1. Let's parse that. The atoms in order: O=C1 (atom 1), N (atom 2), C (atom 3), C (atom 4), =O (atom 5?), N (atom 6?), and then back to C1. Wait, maybe the SMARTS is written as O=C1-N-C-C(=O)-N-C1. So the ring is O=C1 connected to N (atom 2), then two carbons (3 and 4), then a carbonyl (O=C) connected to N (atom 5), and back to C1. That would form a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1 and 4 (O=C1 and C(=O) at position 4). But that's not the correct positions for 2,5-diketopiperazine. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me clarify.

Piperazine is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 1 and 4. In piperazine-2,5-dione, the carbonyl groups are at positions 2 and 5. So the structure would be:

N1-C2(=O)-C3-C4(=O)-N5-C6-C1.

So the ring is N1 connected to C2 (with a carbonyl), then C3, C4 (with carbonyl), N5, C6, back to N1. Wait, that's a six-membered ring. So the two ketones are on C2 and C4 (positions 2 and 5 in the numbering? Maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMARTS is N1C(=O)CC(=O)NCC1. Let me check the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMARTS pattern should be "[O]=C1NCC(=O)NC1", which is what the previous code used. But maybe the actual molecules have different arrangements, such as substituents on the nitrogen atoms or adjacent carbons, which the SMARTS pattern doesn't account for.

Wait, looking at the example SMILES for valid cases, like piperazine-2,5-dione (SMILES: O=C1CNC(=O)CN1). The SMARTS pattern "[O]=C1NCC(=O)NC1" would match this, right? Let's see: O=C1 connected to N, then two Cs, then O=C connected to N, then back to C1. Yes. But some of the false negatives have different structures. For example, plinabulin's SMILES is CC(C)(C)C1=C(\C=C2/NC(=O)\C(NC2=O)=C\C2=CC=CC=C2)N=CN1. Here, the diketopiperazine ring might have substituents or double bonds that the original SMARTS doesn't capture.

Another example: albonoursin's SMILES is CC(C)\C=C1/NC(=O)\C(NC1=O)=C\C1=CC=CC=C1. The core ring here is O=C1N-C(=C)-C(=O)-N-C1, which has a double bond in the ring. The original SMARTS pattern uses single bonds, so it wouldn't match this structure. That's why albonoursin was a false negative.

So the problem is that the original SMARTS pattern requires single bonds between the carbons in the ring. But in reality, some 2,5-diketopiperazines have double bonds or other substituents in the ring. The SMARTS needs to be adjusted to allow for different bond types and substituents.

To fix this, the SMARTS pattern should be more flexible. The key features are:

1. A six-membered ring.
2. Two ketone groups (O=C) at positions 2 and 5 (relative to the piperazine numbering).
3. Two nitrogen atoms in the ring.

But allowing for any bond order between the atoms in the ring (since double bonds can exist) and allowing substituents on the non-ketone carbons.

An improved SMARTS pattern could be "[O]=C1N[CH2,CH1,CH0,CX3,CX4][CH2,CH1,CH0,CX3,CX4]C(=O)N1". But maybe that's not precise. Alternatively, use a more generic pattern that captures the two ketones and the two nitrogens in the ring, regardless of the bond order between the carbons.

Another approach is to look for a six-membered ring with exactly two carbonyl groups and two nitrogen atoms. The carbonyls should be separated by two carbons each. Wait, in piperazine-2,5-dione, the two carbonyls are on adjacent carbons? No, the piperazine ring has two nitrogens. Let's think: the correct structure is N-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-N-C-C. So the two carbonyls are on the second and fifth positions (if the ring is numbered starting at one nitrogen as position 1).

Alternatively, using SMARTS that allows any arrangement as long as there are two carbonyl groups in the ring and two nitrogens, with the carbonyls positioned appropriately.

But perhaps a better way is to create a SMARTS pattern that matches any six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two nitrogen atoms, where the ketones are not adjacent and the nitrogens are in positions 1 and 4 (piperazine-like). However, creating such a pattern is complex.

Alternatively, use a more flexible SMARTS pattern that allows for varying bonds and substituents. For example, using "O=C1N**C(=O)N1", where the ** represents any two atoms (could be carbons with any bonds or substituents). Wait, but that might not enforce the six-membered ring.

Wait, the correct approach is to define a six-membered ring where two of the atoms are carbonyl groups (O=C), and two are nitrogens. The positions of the carbonyls should be such that they are separated by two carbons. For example, in the ring, the order is N-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-N-C-C. So the SMARTS could be written as "[O]=C1NCC(=O)NCC1", but allowing for any bond types between the carbons.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS pattern that doesn't specify the bonds between the carbons, only that they are connected. For example:

"[O]=C1N-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1"

But using the tilde (~) to denote any bond. Wait, SMARTS uses "-" for single bonds, "=" for double, etc. To allow any bond type, we can use "~". So maybe:

"[O]=C1N~C~C(=O)N~C~C1"

But that might not capture the correct arrangement. Alternatively, use a more generic approach.

Another way: the core structure is a six-membered ring with two amide groups (N-C(=O)). The two amides should be across from each other. So the pattern would look for two N-C(=O) groups in the ring, separated by two carbons.

But how to represent that in SMARTS? Perhaps using a SMARTS pattern that matches any six-membered ring with two N-C(=O) groups, where the two N are separated by two carbons.

Alternatively, the correct SMARTS pattern should be "[O]=C1~N~C~C~C(=O)~N~1", forming a six-membered ring with two ketones and two nitrogens. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct SMARTS is "[O]=C1N~C~C(=O)N~C~C1". But the exact arrangement depends on the ring closure.

Alternatively, use a SMARTS that allows any bond between the atoms except the carbonyls. For example:

"[O]=C1-[N]-[C,CX3,CX4]-[C,CX3,CX4]-C(=O)-[N]-1"

This would match a six-membered ring where the first atom is O=C, followed by N, then two carbons (any hybridization), then C=O, then N, and back to the first atom. This allows for double bonds or substituents on the carbons between the nitrogens.

Testing this pattern with the example SMILES:

For piperazine-2,5-dione (SMILES: O=C1CNC(=O)CN1), the pattern would match. For albonoursin (SMILES: CC(C)\C=C1/NC(=O)\C(NC1=O)=C\C1=CC=CC=C1), the core ring is O=C1N-C(=C)-C(=O)-N-C1. The two carbons between the nitrogens are connected by a double bond. The SMARTS pattern "[O]=C1-[N]-[C,CX3,CX4]-[C,CX3,CX4]-C(=O)-[N]-1" would match this because the two middle carbons can be any type (including double bond).

Another example: plinabulin's SMILES is CC(C)(C)C1=C(\C=C2/NC(=O)\C(NC2=O)=C\C2=CC=CC=C2)N=CN1. The core ring here is O=C1N-C(=C)-C(=O)-N-C1, which should match the improved SMARTS.

So, modifying the SMARTS to allow any bonds between the carbons and any substituents on them should capture more cases.

Additionally, checking that the ring is six-membered and has exactly two ketone groups. The original code only checked for the presence of the SMARTS pattern but didn't ensure that the entire ring is part of the structure. For example, if the SMARTS matches a substructure that's part of a larger ring, it might lead to false positives.

To address this, the code should verify that the matched atoms form a six-membered ring. However, that might be complex. Alternatively, rely on the SMARTS pattern to correctly identify the core.

Another issue with the previous code was that it didn't account for possible charges (like in the anion examples). The SMILES for neoechinulin B anion has [N-], but the original SMARTS didn't account for charged nitrogens. So the SMARTS should allow for possible charges on the nitrogens.

Wait, in the false negatives, some anions had [N-] in the SMILES. For example, neoechinulin B anion: SMILES: O=C\1NC(C(=O)[N-]/C1=C/C=2C=3C(NC2C(C=C)(C)C)=CC=CC3)=C. The nitrogen in the ring might be deprotonated and carry a negative charge. The original SMARTS pattern didn't account for charged nitrogens, so it didn't match.

Thus, the SMARTS should allow for possible charges on the nitrogens. Modify the SMARTS to include [N&-,N+0].

Putting this all together, the improved SMARTS pattern would be:

"[O]=C1-[N&H0&v3]-[C,c;X3,X4]-[C,c;X3,X4]-C(=O)-[N&H0&v3]-1"

Breaking this down:

- O=C1: The first atom is a carbonyl oxygen connected to carbon 1.
- [N&H0&v3]: The next atom is a nitrogen with valence 3 and no hydrogens (since it's part of the ring and possibly deprotonated).
- [C,c;X3,X4]: The next two atoms can be any carbon (aromatic or aliphatic) with valence 3 or 4, allowing for double bonds or substituents.
- C(=O): The fifth atom is another carbonyl.
- [N&H0&v3]: The sixth atom is another nitrogen with the same properties.
- Closing the ring with -1.

This pattern should match the core structure even with double bonds, substituents, or charges.

Additionally, after finding a match, we should ensure that the entire ring is part of the molecule and not part of a larger ring system. But checking that might be complex. Alternatively, if the SMARTS is specific enough, it might suffice.

Another improvement: check that there are exactly two carbonyl groups in the molecule. Wait, noâ€”some molecules might have additional carbonyls outside the core. So that's not necessary.

Now, let's adjust the code to use the improved SMARTS pattern and handle charges.

The revised code would:

1. Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern that allows for double bonds, substituents, and charged nitrogens.
2. Check for the presence of this pattern in the molecule.

Testing with the examples:

- For albonoursin (SMILES: CC(C)\C=C1/NC(=O)\C(NC1=O)=C\C1=CC=CC=C1), the SMARTS should match the core O=C1N-C(=C)-C(=O)-N-C1.
- For plinabulin, the core O=C1N-C(=C)-C(=O)-N-C1 should match.
- For the anion examples, the nitrogens with charges should be matched by [N&H0&v3], which allows for charged N.

This should reduce false negatives. For false positives, the improved SMARTS should be more specific. For example, molecules where the core is part of a larger ring system might not match if the SMARTS requires exactly six atoms in the ring.

Wait, but how does the SMARTS pattern handle larger rings? For example, if the core is part of a bicyclic system, the SMARTS would still match if the six atoms form a ring. But perhaps some false positives are due to the core being part of a larger ring. To address this, maybe we can check that the matched atoms form a single six-membered ring. However, implementing that would require checking the ring membership of the matched atoms, which adds complexity.

Alternatively, rely on the SMARTS pattern to correctly identify the core. Given time constraints, focusing on improving the SMARTS to cover more cases is the priority.

So, the revised code would use a more flexible SMARTS pattern and account for possible charges. Let's implement that.
