"""
Hmm, wait. The error was an unterminated string literal. Oh, right! The docstring for the function wasn't properly closed. In the previous code, maybe the triple quotes were missing or there was a typo. Let me check the previous code. Oh, looking at the example for triglyceride, the docstring starts with """ and ends with """. If the previous code had a missing quote, that would cause the error. Also, in the code above, the docstring for the function is properly enclosed. So maybe the user's previous code had a mistake in the docstring formatting. Also, the SMARTS patterns need to be correct. Let's check the current code.

The current code checks for exactly one carboxylic acid group. That's correct because it's a monocarboxylic acid. Then, it looks for a ketone adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The first pattern [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1] might not be correct. Because the carboxylic acid has the structure -C(=O)OH. The adjacent carbon (the alpha carbon) should have a ketone group. So the structure would be:

R-C(=O)-C(=O)-OH ?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid would have the oxo group on the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, the oxo (ketone) is on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O=C-COOH ?

Wait, no. Wait, the carboxylic acid is -COOH. The 2-oxo substituent would be on the adjacent carbon. So the structure would be:

R-C(=O)-C(=O)OH ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Let's think. The carboxylic acid is the -COOH group. The 2-oxo would be on the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon. So the carboxylic acid's carbon is position 1, and the oxo is on position 2. So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-COOH ?

No, that's a 3-oxo. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

R-C(=O)-C(OH)=O ?

No, that's not right. Wait, maybe the correct structure is the carboxylic acid is on a carbon, and the adjacent carbon (alpha carbon) has a ketone group. So the structure would be:

R-C(=O)-C(=O)OH ?

Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-COOH. That's 3-oxopropanoic acid. But 2-oxo would be propanoic acid with the oxo on the second carbon. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-oxo would be CH2(CO)COOH. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon (the end), and the oxo is on the second carbon. So for example, pyruvic acid is CH3-C(=O)-COOH. Wait, no, pyruvic acid is CH2-C(=O)-COOH. Wait, the structure of pyruvic acid is:

O=C-C(OH)-COOH? No, wait. Pyruvic acid is CH3-CO-COOH. Wait, no. Let me check. Pyruvic acid is CH2-C(O)-COOH. Wait, no. Wait, pyruvic acid is actually CH3-C(=O)-COOH. So the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon (if the chain is numbered from the ketone). But the definition says "2-oxo substituent". So maybe the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is position 1, then the adjacent carbon (position 2) has the oxo group. So the structure would be:

COOH-C(=O)-R. But that's not possible because the carboxylic acid is a terminal group. So perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a ketone group (oxo) on the adjacent carbon. For example, pyruvic acid is CH3-C(=O)-COOH. Wait, in that case, the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon (if the chain is three carbons). But according to the definition, the oxo is on the second carbon. So perhaps the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. Let me think: the carboxylic acid is the -COOH group. The adjacent carbon (alpha carbon) is position 2. So in pyruvic acid, the structure is:

COOH-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, that's not correct. Pyruvic acid is actually CH2(CO)COOH. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-COOH. So the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon (if the chain is three carbons). Wait, perhaps the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the carbon with the COOH is position 1, the next carbon (position 2) has the oxo group. So the structure would be:

COOH-C(=O)-R. But that's not possible because the carbon adjacent to COOH (position 2) would need to have a double bond to oxygen (oxo). So that's exactly the case in pyruvic acid. Wait, pyruvic acid is:

CH3-C(=O)-COOH. Wait, no. Let me look up pyruvic acid's structure. Pyruvic acid is CH3-CO-COOH. Wait, no. Actually, pyruvic acid is CH2(CO)COOH. Wait, the correct SMILES for pyruvic acid is CC(=O)C(O)=O. Wait, no. The correct SMILES for pyruvic acid is CC(=O)C(=O)O. Wait, no. Let me check. Pyruvic acid is alpha-keto propanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The alpha carbon is the one next to the COOH. So the structure would be CH2(C=O)COOH. So the SMILES would be O=C(C)C(=O)O. Wait, but that would have two ketones. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the actual SMILES given in the examples. The user provided pyruvic acid's SMILES as CC(=O)C(O)=O. Wait, that's not correct. Because that would be a carboxylic acid (C(O)=O) and a ketone (C(=O)). So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-C(OOH). Wait, but the actual structure of pyruvic acid is CH3-C(=O)-COOH. So the SMILES should be CC(=O)C(=O)O. Wait, but that's two ketones. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the SMILES provided by the user is incorrect, but according to the examples, pyruvic acid's SMILES is CC(=O)C(O)=O, which would be CC(=O)C(O)=O. That's actually a geminal diol, which is not correct. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, the code needs to correctly identify 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

So the key points are:

1. The molecule must have exactly one carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
2. The carboxylic acid's adjacent carbon (alpha carbon) must have an oxo group (ketone).

So the code should check for the presence of a carboxylic acid and a ketone on the adjacent carbon.

In the previous code, the first SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid is [CX3](=O)[OX2H1], which matches a carboxylic acid group. Then, the code checks for an oxo group adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon.

The initial approach using the SMARTS pattern [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1] might not work because it's looking for a carbon with a ketone adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon. Let's see: the carboxylic acid's carbon is CX3(=O) connected to OX2H1. Then, adjacent to that carbon (CX3(=O)), there's another CX3(=O) (the ketone). But that would require the structure to be O=C-C(=O)OH, which is not possible. Wait, that's oxalic acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid. But the examples include pyruvic acid, which is CC(=O)C(O)=O. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, maybe the user's example SMILES for pyruvic acid is incorrect, but according to the code, it should pass.

Wait, let's parse the SMILES for pyruvic acid given in the examples: CC(=O)C(O)=O. That's a carboxylic acid (C(O)=O) attached to a carbon that has a ketone (C(=O)). So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-C(OOH). But that's not possible because the carbon adjacent to the ketone can't have two oxygen substituents like that. Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is CC(=O)C(=O)O, which would be a diketone with a hydroxyl group. Hmm, perhaps the example SMILES is wrong, but the code needs to handle the correct cases.

But regardless, the code should check for a carboxylic acid and a ketone on the adjacent carbon.

So the correct approach is:

1. Find the carboxylic acid group.
2. Find the alpha carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon).
3. Check if the alpha carbon has a ketone group (C=O).

In the previous code, the first SMARTS pattern [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1] is looking for a carbon with a ketone adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon. But maybe that's not the right way. Let's break it down.

The carboxylic acid's carbon is matched by [CX3](=O)[OX2H1]. The adjacent carbon (alpha carbon) should have a ketone group. So the SMARTS pattern should be [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O), where the first CX3 is the carboxylic acid's carbon, and the second CX3 is the alpha carbon with the ketone.

But the code's first check uses [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1], which would require the alpha carbon to be part of another carboxylic acid group, which isn't correct. So that SMARTS pattern is wrong. That's why the code is failing.

So the correct SMARTS pattern for the adjacent ketone would be:

carboxylic_acid_carbon = [CX3](=O)[OX2H1]
adjacent_ketone = [CX3](=O)

So the entire pattern would be [CX3](=O)[OX2H1]-[CX3](=O)

But SMARTS patterns need to be written properly. Let's construct it correctly.

The correct SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid's carbon connected to the alpha carbon with a ketone would be:

[CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)

But the carboxylic acid's oxygen is [OX2H1]. So the full pattern would be:

[CX3](=O)(-[OX2H1])-[CX3](=O)

Wait, but the carboxylic acid's carbon is connected to the oxygen (O) of the COOH group. So the SMARTS should be:

[CX3](=O)(-[OX2H1])-[CX3](=O)

But that would match a structure where the carboxylic acid's carbon is connected to another carbon with a ketone. Let's test this with pyruvic acid's correct SMILES. If pyruvic acid is CC(=O)C(=O)O, then the SMILES is O=C(C)C(=O)O, which is O=C(C)C(=O)O. But that's a dicarboxylic acid, which isn't correct. Wait, no. Pyruvic acid should be CH3-C(=O)-COOH. So the SMILES would be CC(=O)C(=O)O. But that's two carboxylic acid groups. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES for pyruvic acid is CC(=O)C(O)=O. Wait, that's CC(=O)C(O)=O. The structure would be:

CH3-C(=O)-C(OH)=O. But that's not a valid structure because the carbon with OH and =O would have three bonds (O and OH), which is not possible. So maybe the example SMILES is incorrect, but according to the user's examples, it's considered a valid 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid.

Regardless, the code needs to find a carboxylic acid and a ketone on the adjacent carbon.

Another approach is to find the carboxylic acid group, then check the adjacent carbon for a ketone.

So in code:

1. Find all carboxylic acid groups. If there's exactly one, proceed.
2. Get the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid (the one connected to the =O and -OH).
3. Check the adjacent carbons (connected via single bonds) to see if any of them have a ketone group (=O).

So in code:

After finding the carboxylic acid group, get the carbon atom (let's call it carb_carbon). Then, iterate through the neighboring atoms of carb_carbon. For each neighbor, check if it's a carbon with a ketone group.

So the code should:

carb_carbon = carboxylic_matches[0][0]  # assuming the first atom in the match is the carbon
for neighbor in carb_carbon.GetNeighbors():
    if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # carbon
        # check if this neighbor has a ketone group
        for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
            if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:
                if bond.GetBeginAtom().GetAtomicNum() == 8 or bond.GetEndAtom().GetAtomicNum() == 8:
                    # check if it's a ketone (C=O)
                    # alternative approach: check if the neighbor has a double bond to oxygen
                    if neighbor.HasSubstructMatch(Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CX3]=O")):
                        return True

But this might be more reliable than using SMARTS patterns.

Alternatively, use SMARTS to find a carboxylic acid carbon adjacent to a carbon with a ketone.

The correct SMARTS pattern would be:

carboxylic_acid_adjacent_ketone = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]-[CX3]=O")

This pattern matches a carboxylic acid carbon ([CX3](=O)[OX2H1]) connected to a carbon with a ketone ([CX3]=O).

So in code:

pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]-[CX3]=O")
if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
    return True, "..."

But wait, this would require the carboxylic acid's carbon to be directly bonded to the ketone's carbon. So the structure would be:

O=C-O-C(=O)-...

No, that's not correct. Wait, the carboxylic acid's carbon is connected to the adjacent carbon (alpha carbon) via a single bond, and the alpha carbon has a ketone. So the structure is:

R-C(=O)-C(=O)-OH ?

No, that's not possible. The correct structure is:

R-C(=O)-C(COOH)...

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's take an example from the user's examples. Take pyruvic acid's SMILES: CC(=O)C(O)=O. Parsing this SMILES, the structure is:

The molecule is CC(=O)C(O)=O. Let's draw it:

Carbon chain: C-C(=O)-C(O)=O.

Wait, but the third carbon has O= and -O. That would imply a double bond to O and a single bond to O, which is possible as a carboxylic acid group. Wait, no. The correct carboxylic acid group is -C(=O)OH. So in SMILES, it's written as C(=O)O. So the SMILES CC(=O)C(O)=O would imply:

First carbon: CH3-

Second carbon: C(=O)-

Third carbon: C(O)=O → which is O=C-O. That's not possible. So perhaps the SMILES provided is incorrect, but the code needs to handle the valid cases.

Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES for pyruvic acid is CC(=O)C(=O)OH, but that's not valid either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is CC(=O)C(O)OH, which would be a geminal diol, which is not correct for pyruvic acid. This suggests that the example SMILES might have errors, but the code should still work for valid 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

Regardless, the code needs to correctly identify the presence of a carboxylic acid and a ketone on the adjacent carbon.

In the previous code, the SMARTS pattern [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1] is incorrect because it's looking for a ketone adjacent to the carboxylic acid's carbon, but the [OX2H1] is part of the carboxylic acid group. The correct pattern should be the carboxylic acid's carbon connected to a carbon with a ketone.

So the correct SMARTS pattern would be:

[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]-[CX3]=O

But wait, the carboxylic acid's carbon is connected to the oxygen (O in -OH). So the adjacent carbon (alpha) is connected via a single bond. So the pattern should be:

[CX3](=O)-[CX3]=O

But with the carboxylic acid's oxygen attached. So:

[CX3](=O)(-[OX2H1])-[CX3]=O

This pattern matches a carbon (CX3) with a double bond to O (carboxylic acid's carbonyl), an -OH group (OX2H1), and a single bond to another carbon (CX3) with a double bond to O (ketone).

So the SMARTS would be "[CX3](=O)(-[OX2H1])-[CX3]=O".

In code:

pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CX3](=O)(-[OX2H1])-[CX3]=O")
if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
    return True, "Found adjacent oxo group"

But this may not cover all cases, especially where the ketone is on a branched carbon.

Alternatively, after finding the carboxylic acid group, we can check all adjacent carbons for a ketone.

So the code should:

1. Find the carboxylic acid group.
2. Get the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid.
3. Check all neighboring carbons to see if any have a ketone group.

So in code:

carboxylic_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid)
if len(carboxylic_matches) != 1:
    return False, ...
carb_carbon_idx = carboxylic_matches[0][0]
carb_carbon = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(carb_carbon_idx)

# Check neighbors of carb_carbon
found_oxo = False
for neighbor in carb_carbon.GetNeighbors():
    if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # carbon
        # Check if this neighbor has a ketone group
        for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
            if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:
                other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # oxygen
                    found_oxo = True
                    break
        if found_oxo:
            break

if not found_oxo:
    return False, "No oxo group adjacent to carboxylic acid"

This approach would check if any adjacent carbon to the carboxylic acid's carbon has a double bond to oxygen (ketone).

This method is more flexible and would handle different structures, including branched ones.

So integrating this into the code:

After verifying the presence of exactly one carboxylic acid group, get the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid. Then check its neighbors for a ketone.

This should correctly identify 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

Additionally, the code should also check that there's only one carboxylic acid group (monocarboxylic), which the initial code does.

Putting it all together:

The code should:

- Parse the SMILES.
- Check for exactly one carboxylic acid group.
- Check that the carboxylic acid's carbon has a neighboring carbon with a ketone group.

This approach should handle the examples correctly.

In the previous code, the error was likely due to a syntax error (unterminated string), but after fixing that, the logic may still have issues. For example, the SMARTS pattern [CX3](=O)-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1] is incorrect. The current code also has a fallback check where it looks for ketones and checks adjacency, which might work.

But to improve accuracy, using the neighbor-checking approach would be better.

So revising the code accordingly.

Another possible issue is that the code may not consider the possibility of the oxo group being on a different position. For example, if the carboxylic acid is on a longer chain, the oxo could be on the second carbon (adjacent), which is what the definition requires.

So the code should ensure that the oxo is on the adjacent carbon to the carboxylic acid's carbon.

Thus, the revised code should:

1. Check for exactly one carboxylic acid.
2. Check that the carboxylic acid's carbon has a neighboring carbon with a ketone.

Implementing this in code:

def is_2_oxo_monocarboxylic_acid(smiles: str):
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if mol is None:
        return False, "Invalid SMILES string"

    # Check for exactly one carboxylic acid group
    carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts("[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]")
    carboxylic_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid)
    if len(carboxylic_matches) != 1:
        return False, f"Found {len(carboxylic_matches)} carboxylic acid groups, need exactly 1"

    # Get the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid
    carb_carbon_idx = carboxylic_matches[0][0]
    carb_carbon = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(carb_carbon_idx)

    # Check adjacent carbons for a ketone group
    found_oxo = False
    for neighbor in carb_carbon.GetNeighbors():
        if neighbor.GetAtomicNum() == 6:  # Carbon atom
            # Check if this neighbor has a double bond to oxygen (ketone)
            for bond in neighbor.GetBonds():
                if bond.GetBondType() == Chem.BondType.DOUBLE:
                    other_atom = bond.GetOtherAtom(neighbor)
                    if other_atom.GetAtomicNum() == 8:  # Oxygen
                        found_oxo = True
                        break
            if found_oxo:
                break

    if not found_oxo:
        return False, "No oxo group adjacent to carboxylic acid"

    return True, "Contains a monocarboxylic acid with adjacent 2-oxo group"

This code first checks for exactly one carboxylic acid group. Then, it checks the adjacent carbons to the carboxylic acid's carbon for a ketone (double bond to oxygen). If found, returns True.

This should correctly identify 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

Testing this code with the example SMILES provided:

For pyruvic acid's SMILES: CC(=O)C(O)=O (which may be incorrect), let's parse it. The carboxylic acid group is the C(O)=O. The adjacent carbon (the middle C) has a ketone (C=O). Wait, the structure is:

C-C(=O)-C(O)=O. The middle carbon is connected to a ketone (C=O) and the third carbon has a carboxylic acid group. So the adjacent carbon to the carboxylic acid's carbon (third carbon) is the middle carbon. The middle carbon has a ketone. So the code would find that the third carbon's neighbor (middle C) has a ketone. Thus, returns True.

Another example: phenylglyoxylic acid, SMILES OC(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1. The carboxylic acid is the OC(=O) group. The adjacent carbon is the C(=O) group (ketone). So the code would find the ketone on the adjacent carbon, returns True.

Another example: 2-oxododecanoic acid, SMILES C(CCCCCCCC(C(=O)O)=O)CC. Wait, that SMILES may be incorrect. Let's parse it. The structure is a long chain with a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O) and a ketone on the adjacent carbon. The code should detect that.

Thus, the revised code should work correctly.

Now, to write the code with proper formatting and ensure there are no syntax errors. Also, ensure that the docstring is properly closed and there are no indentation issues.

The previous error was an unterminated string literal, which suggests that the docstring wasn't properly closed. So ensuring that the triple quotes are correctly placed.

Final code:
