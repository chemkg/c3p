Okay, I need to create a function called is_N_acyl_L_alpha_amino_acid that checks if a given SMILES string represents an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid. The definition is any L-alpha-amino acid with an N-acyl substituent. Let's break this down.

First, an L-alpha-amino acid has a specific structure: a central carbon (the alpha carbon) bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen, and a side chain. The L-configuration refers to the stereochemistry, so the amino group should be in the correct orientation.

The N-acyl part means that the amino group (NH2) is modified with an acyl group, turning it into an amide (N-C=O). So the molecule should have an amide group attached to the alpha nitrogen.

Steps to check:
1. Parse the SMILES into a molecule. If invalid, return False.
2. Identify the alpha carbon. This is the carbon adjacent to both the amino and carboxyl groups.
3. Check that the amino group is part of an amide (acyl group attached). So look for a nitrogen connected to a carbonyl group (C=O).
4. Ensure the amino acid is in the L-configuration. RDKit can help with stereochemistry checks.
5. Verify the presence of a carboxyl group (
