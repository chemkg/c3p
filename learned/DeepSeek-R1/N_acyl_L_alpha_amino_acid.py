Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The main issues were false positives and false negatives. 

Looking at the false positives, many were dipeptides or tripeptides. The original code checked for any amide group and an alpha carbon connected to a carboxyl and nitrogen. But in peptides, each amino acid has that structure, leading to incorrect classifications. So the code needs to ensure there's only one amino acid backbone, not multiple.

For false negatives, like N-[4-(indol-3-yl)butanoyl]-L-cysteine, the code might have missed the stereochemistry check. Maybe the chiral center wasn't properly detected because the code returns after finding the first S-configuration alpha carbon, but in some cases, there might be multiple chiral centers, or the code didn't check all possible alpha carbons.

Another problem could be the way the alpha carbon is identified. The original code looks for a carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group, but in some structures, the alpha carbon might be part of a larger group, or the code might not traverse correctly.

To fix this, the approach should be:

1. **Identify the amino acid backbone**: Look for the classic alpha-amino acid structure (NH2-CH(R)-COOH). Since it's N-acyl, the amino group is part of an amide, so the nitrogen should be connected to a carbonyl.

2. **Check for exactly one amino acid backbone**: To avoid peptides, ensure there's only one alpha carbon with the required structure.

3. **Stereochemistry check**: Verify that the alpha carbon has the L-configuration (S in RDKit's terms).

4. **Acyl group presence**: Ensure the nitrogen is part of an acyl group (amide), not just any amine.

So the revised steps would be:

- Find all carboxyl groups.
- For each carboxyl, check if it's part of an amino acid backbone.
- Ensure the nitrogen is acylated (connected to a carbonyl).
- Check the stereochemistry of the alpha carbon.
- Exclude molecules with multiple amino acid backbones (like peptides).

By focusing on a single amino acid structure and proper acylation checks, we can reduce false positives from peptides and catch the correct cases.
