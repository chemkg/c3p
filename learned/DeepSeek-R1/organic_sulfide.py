    """
    Determines if a molecule is an organic sulfide (thioether) based on its SMILES string.
    Organic sulfides have the structure R-S-R' where R and R' are non-hydrogen atoms connected via single bonds,
    and sulfur is not part of an aromatic system.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is an organic sulfide, False otherwise
