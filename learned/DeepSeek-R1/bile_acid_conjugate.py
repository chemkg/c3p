Classifies: CHEBI:36249 bile acid conjugate

Okay, let's figure out why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was really low, so there were a lot of false positives and negatives. Let's look at the examples provided.

False positives: The model incorrectly classified molecules like Goyasaponin II and others. These have conjugated groups like glucuronate but lack the bile acid steroid core. The previous code checked for at least 3 rings and hydroxyl groups, but maybe that's not specific enough. Steroid cores usually have four fused rings (three 6-membered and one 5-membered), so just checking ring count isn't sufficient.

False negatives: Many true bile acid conjugates were missed. For example, glycodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate wasn't detected. The conjugated group patterns might be too strict. The glycine pattern [NH1]C(=O)CC(=O)O might not match all cases. Also, some conjugates might have different connectivity, like the sulfate being attached directly to the steroid, not as an ester.

So, improvements needed:

1. **Better steroid core detection**: Use a substructure pattern for the tetracyclic steroid system instead of just counting rings. The four fused rings are crucial.

2. **Expand conjugated group patterns**: The previous patterns were too narrow. For example, glycine conjugates have an amide linkage (NC(=O)COO), not necessarily both carbonyls. Taurine's pattern should end with sulfonic acid (-S(=O)(=O)O). Also, check for amino acids (like lysine, serine) via their general structure (amine connected to carbonyl).

3. **Handle different conjugation positions**: Sulfate could be attached via oxygen (O-SO3) or directly. Glucuronate might be linked via the carboxylate.

4. **Adjust molecular weight check**: Some conjugates might be lighter, but maybe the cutoff was too high. Let's check examples to find a better threshold.

Let's revise the code:

- Use a steroid SMARTS pattern for the core.
- Broaden conjugated group detection to include various amino acids, sulfate esters, sulfonates, glucuronides, etc.
- Check for amide or ester bonds connecting the conjugated group to the steroid.
- Adjust the molecular weight cutoff based on actual examples.

Testing these changes should reduce false positives by ensuring the steroid core is present and improve detection of various conjugated groups, reducing false negatives.
