Okay, let's see why the previous code didn't work well. The F1 score was really low, so there were a lot of false positives and negatives. Let me look at the outcomes.

The false positives included molecules like complex glycans and other hydroxylated compounds that aren't tannins. The previous code checked for high hydroxylation and molecular weight, which probably let in those sugars. For example, some false positives had many OH groups but were carbohydrates, not polyphenolic tannins.

False negatives included molecules like Isogomisin O and Ellagic acid pentoside. The code might have missed them because it relied too much on specific patterns like galloyl groups or flavan-3-ol subunits. Maybe those structures have different arrangements of phenolic groups that weren't captured by the existing SMARTS patterns.

So, what's wrong with the previous approach? Let's break it down:

1. **Galloyl Detection**: The galloyl pattern was looking for 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate esters. But maybe the SMARTS pattern wasn't accurate. Also, some tannins have galloyl groups attached in different ways, or other polyphenolic structures like ellagic acid derivatives.

2. **HHDP Group**: The hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) pattern might not have been correctly defined. The SMARTS for HHDP might need adjustment to capture the correct connectivity.

3. **Flavan-3-ol Detection**: The pattern for condensed tannins (flavan-3-ol oligomers) might not be comprehensive enough. Maybe it missed some variations in the structure, like different substitution patterns or linkages.

4. **Hydroxylation Check**: The code considered total hydroxyls and molecular weight, but this led to false positives from non-tannin hydroxylated compounds (like sugars). Need a better way to ensure the hydroxyls are part of polyphenolic systems.

5. **Glucose Core Check**: The ester count on glucose might not have been accurate. Some hydrolyzable tannins have multiple galloyl or ellagic acid groups attached, but the code's ester detection might not have captured that correctly.

**Improvements to Try:**

- **Revise Galloyl Detection**: Use a more precise SMARTS for galloyl groups. Galloyl is 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid ester. The pattern should ensure the three OH groups are on the benzene ring in the correct positions.

- **Improve HHDP Detection**: The HHDP group is two galloyl units linked by a C-C bond. The SMARTS should check for two benzene rings each with three OH groups, connected appropriately.

- **Better Flavan-3-ol Patterns**: The previous pattern might not account for different substitution positions or oligomer linkages. Maybe look for the flavan backbone with multiple hydroxyls and check for oligomerization via substructure matches.

- **Polyphenolic Check**: Instead of just counting OHs, ensure they are part of aromatic rings (phenolic groups). Use SMARTS to count the number of phenolic hydroxyls (OH attached to aromatic carbons) and require a minimum.

- **Adjust Molecular Weight Threshold**: Some tannins are smaller, but maybe the cutoff was too high. However, the examples show MWs around 500+, so maybe keep but combine with other features.

- **Check for Multiple Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyls**: Tannins are polyphenolic, so having multiple aromatic rings each with several hydroxyls is key. Use SMARTS to find rings with at least two adjacent OHs (catechol) or three (pyrogallol) and count them.

- **Reduce Reliance on Glucose Core**: Some tannins like ellagitannins might not have a glucose core. So, the glucose check should be one of several criteria, not a must-have.

**Implementing Changes:**

1. **Galloyl SMARTS**: Use `[OX2]C(=O)c1c(O)c(O)c(O)cc1` to match the ester of 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid.

2. **HHDP SMARTS**: Look for two galloyl groups connected by a bond. Maybe `c1c(O)c(O)c(-c2c(O)c(O)c(O)cc2)c(O)c1`.

3. **Flavan-3-ol**: Use a more general pattern for the flavan unit, perhaps with hydroxyls in typical positions.

4. **Polyphenolic Check**: Count the number of aromatic rings with at least two hydroxyls. Require a minimum number (like 3 or more).

5. **Combine Features**: Require either galloyl/HHDP groups, flavan oligomers, or sufficient polyphenolic rings with high hydroxylation and MW.

Let me adjust the code with these improvements. Also, ensure that the checks for hydroxyls are on aromatic rings to avoid counting sugars' OHs. Add a check for the presence of multiple phenolic groups (catechol/pyrogallol) and combine with molecular weight. Also, refine the glucose core check to look for specific ester attachments related to tannins.

Another thing: the previous code returned true if there was high hydroxylation and MW >500, which caused sugars to be false positives. Instead, require that the hydroxyls are part of aromatic systems (phenolic OH) and have a certain count.

Let's structure the code to first check for specific tannin features (galloyl, HHDP, flavan-3-ol oligomers), then check for general polyphenolic characteristics with sufficient phenolic OHs and MW.

Also, the false negatives like Ellagic acid pentoside might have been missed because the HH
