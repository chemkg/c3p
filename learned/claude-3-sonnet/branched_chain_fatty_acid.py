"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35819 branched-chain fatty acid
"""
Let me analyze the issues with the previous code based on the outcomes:

1. False Positives Analysis:
- Many unsaturated fatty acids without branching were wrongly classified (e.g., octadecylenic acid, cis-undec-2-enoic acid)
- Some dicarboxylic acids were wrongly classified (e.g., 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid)
- Some amino acids were wrongly classified (e.g., D-alloisoleucine)
- Some prostaglandins and other complex lipids were wrongly classified

2. False Negatives Analysis:
- Simple branched unsaturated acids were missed (e.g., 4-methyl-4-pentenoic acid)
- Some compounds with sulfur were incorrectly excluded
- Some valid branched structures were not detected by the branching patterns

Key improvements needed:

1. Tighten unsaturation criteria:
- Unsaturation alone should not qualify as branching
- Only count unsaturation when combined with methyl/alkyl branching

2. Improve branching detection:
- Add patterns for vinyl branching (C=C(C)C)
- Better distinguish between backbone unsaturation and branched unsaturation

3. Refine carboxylic acid criteria:
- Exclude compounds with multiple carboxylic acid groups
- Better handle carboxylate salts

4. Adjust heteroatom handling:
- Allow limited sulfur atoms in certain positions
- Better distinguish between fatty acid oxygen and other oxygens

5. Add specific exclusions:
- Exclude prostaglandins and related structures
- Exclude amino acids more effectively
- Exclude phospholipids

Here's how we should modify the code:
1. Add a check for multiple carboxylic acid groups
2. Revise branching patterns to better capture true branched structures
3. Add more specific exclusion patterns
4. Improve the handling of unsaturation in relation to branching
5. Add specific patterns for known branched fatty acid substructures

Would you like me to provide the improved code implementing these changes?
