"""
Classifies: CHEBI:83820 non-proteinogenic amino acid
"""
The previous code appears to have the following issues:

1. **Incomplete amino acid backbone pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the amino acid backbone (`[NX3,NX4;H2]([CH1]([CH3X4,CH2X3,CH1X2,CH0X1])C(=O)[OH,OX1])`) only checks for the presence of an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) connected by a single carbon atom. However, this pattern fails to capture amino acids with more complex side chains or additional functional groups.

2. **Inefficient proteinogenic amino acid exclusion**: The code checks for proteinogenic amino acids by iterating over a list of SMARTS patterns for each individual proteinogenic amino acid. This approach is inefficient and does not scale well as the number of proteinogenic amino acids increases.

3. **Lack of positive identification**: The code only checks for the absence of a proteinogenic amino acid backbone and returns `True` if none is found. However, it does not explicitly check for the presence of non-proteinogenic amino acid features, which may lead to false positives.

To improve the program, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Enhance the amino acid backbone pattern**: Use a more comprehensive SMARTS pattern that captures a broader range of amino acid structures, including those with more complex side chains and additional functional groups.

2. **Improve proteinogenic amino acid exclusion**: Instead of checking for individual proteinogenic amino acids, use a single SMARTS pattern that captures the general structure of proteinogenic amino acids. This can be achieved by identifying the common structural features of proteinogenic amino acids and encoding them in a single pattern.

3. **Incorporate positive identification**: In addition to excluding proteinogenic amino acids, include specific checks for features or substructures that are characteristic of non-proteinogenic amino acids. This will help reduce false positives and improve the overall accuracy of the classification.

4. **Consider additional features**: Explore other molecular descriptors or properties that can aid in the classification of non-proteinogenic amino acids, such as molecular weight, chemical composition, or the presence of specific functional groups.

5. **Utilize machine learning techniques**: If the rule-based approach proves insufficient, consider using machine learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of known non-proteinogenic amino acids and their corresponding features. This may provide a more robust and accurate classification, especially for complex or ambiguous cases.

By addressing these issues, the program should be able to classify non-proteinogenic amino acids more accurately and robustly.
