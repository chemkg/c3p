"""
Classifies: CHEBI:51963 hopanoid
"""
The previous program used a single SMARTS pattern to identify the hopane skeleton. While this pattern can match some hopanoids, it is too specific and fails to capture the structural diversity of this class of compounds. The failed examples show that the hopane skeleton can have various substituents, stereochemistry, and ring conformations that are not covered by the fixed SMARTS pattern.

To improve the program, we need a more flexible approach that can recognize the core pentacyclic ring system while allowing for variations in substitution patterns and stereochemistry. One possible solution is to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Identify the pentacyclic ring system characteristic of hopanoids.
2. Check for specific substituents and stereochemistry associated with hopanoids.
3. Validate additional criteria, such as molecular weight or functional groups.

This multi-step approach allows for a more robust and accurate classification of hopanoids.
