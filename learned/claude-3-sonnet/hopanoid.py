"""
Classifies: CHEBI:51963 hopanoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as hopanoids based on several criteria:

1. Checking for the presence of a pentacyclic hopane skeleton.
2. Checking for common substituent patterns and stereochemistry found in hopanoids.
3. Checking the molecular weight to be within the typical range for hopanoids (400-800 Da).

However, the program failed to correctly identify any of the provided example molecules as hopanoids, resulting in a 0 F1 score.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and ways to improve the program:

1. **Rigid structural matching**: The program relied on finding an exact substructure match for the pentacyclic hopane skeleton. However, many of the example molecules have substituents or different ring conformations that prevent an exact match. To improve this, we could use a more flexible approach like maximum common substructure (MCS) matching or pattern matching with SMARTS strings that allow for variations in ring conformations and substituents.

2. **Limited substituent patterns**: The program only checked for a few specific substituent patterns using SMARTS strings. However, the example molecules exhibit a wide variety of substituents and functional groups, many of which were not covered by the program. We need to expand the set of substituent patterns or use a more general approach to detect typical hopanoid substituents.

3. **Molecular weight constraints**: The molecular weight range of 400-800 Da may be too narrow for some hopanoids, especially those with larger or more complex substituents. We could consider relaxing or removing this constraint, as it may not be as reliable as the structural features.

4. **Lack of stereochemistry handling**: The program did not explicitly consider stereochemistry, which is important for correctly identifying many hopanoids. We should incorporate stereochemical checks or use 3D conformers to ensure that the stereochemistry matches that expected for hopanoids.

5. **Single failure condition**: The program returned False if any of the conditions failed, even if the others were satisfied. We could consider a weighted or voting approach, where the final classification is based on the combination of multiple criteria, rather than a single strict condition.

To improve the program, we could try the following:

1. Use MCS or flexible SMARTS pattern matching to identify the core pentacyclic hopane skeleton, allowing for variations in ring conformations and substituents.
2. Expand the set of SMARTS patterns or use a more general approach (e.g., functional group analysis) to detect common hopanoid substituents and functional groups.
3. Relax or remove the molecular weight constraint, as it may not be as reliable as the structural features.
4. Incorporate stereochemistry checks or use 3D conformers to ensure that the stereochemistry matches that expected for hopanoids.
5. Implement a weighted or voting approach, where the final classification is based on the combination of multiple criteria, rather than a single strict condition.

By addressing these issues, we should be able to improve the performance of the program in correctly identifying hopanoid molecules based on their structural features and substituent patterns.
