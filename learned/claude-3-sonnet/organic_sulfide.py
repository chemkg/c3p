"""
Classifies: CHEBI:16385 organic sulfide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify organic sulfides by checking if the molecule contains at least one sulfur atom with exactly two non-hydrogen substituents. However, the approach had some limitations, which led to a low F1 score of 0.097.

Analysis of the outcomes:

True positives:
The program correctly identified most of the true positive examples by finding sulfur atoms with two non-hydrogen substituents.

False positives:
The program incorrectly classified several molecules as organic sulfides, even though they did not meet the structural criteria. Some of these false positives contained sulfur atoms with more than two substituents or sulfur atoms in different environments (e.g., sulfonates, sulfoxides).

False negatives:
The program missed some true organic sulfide examples. This could be due to the strict requirement of "exactly two non-hydrogen substituents" on the sulfur atom. Some organic sulfides may have additional substituents or different arrangements of substituents around the sulfur atom.

To improve the program's performance, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Relax the substituent count condition**: Instead of checking for "exactly two non-hydrogen substituents," we could check for "at least two non-hydrogen substituents" on the sulfur atom. This would capture a broader range of organic sulfide structures, including those with additional substituents or different arrangements around the sulfur atom.

2. **Use SMARTS patterns**: Instead of explicitly checking the number of substituents, we could define SMARTS patterns that capture the general structure of organic sulfides. SMARTS patterns can be more flexible and can account for different substituent arrangements and additional functional groups.

3. **Exclude specific functional groups**: Identify common functional groups or structural patterns that should be excluded from the organic sulfide definition (e.g., sulfonates, sulfoxides, sulfones) and explicitly check for their absence in the molecule.

4. **Expand the training dataset**: The current dataset may not cover a diverse enough range of organic sulfide structures. Expanding the training dataset with more examples, including edge cases and diverse structural variations, could improve the model's generalization ability.

5. **Consider machine learning approaches**: Instead of relying solely on rule-based approaches, machine learning techniques, such as random forests or neural networks, could be explored. These methods can learn patterns from labeled data and potentially capture more complex structural features associated with organic sulfides.

By implementing one or a combination of these strategies, the program's ability to accurately classify organic sulfides is likely to improve, leading to a higher F1 score.
