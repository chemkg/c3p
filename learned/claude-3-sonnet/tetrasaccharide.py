"""
Classifies: CHEBI:50126 tetrasaccharide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify chemical entities as tetrasaccharides based on several criteria:

1. Counting the number of monosaccharide units (assumed to be rings with size >= 5)
2. Checking for the presence of at least 3 glycosidic bonds (O-C-O pattern)
3. Checking the molecular weight (>600 Da)
4. Counting the number of carbon and oxygen atoms

While these criteria are reasonable, there are several issues that led to poor performance:

1. **Assumption of monosaccharide units being rings**: The program assumed that each monosaccharide unit would be represented as a ring with size >= 5. However, this assumption is not always valid, as some monosaccharides may be represented in a linear form or with smaller rings.

2. **Glycosidic bond pattern**: The O-C-O pattern used to identify glycosidic bonds may not be specific enough, as it could also match other functional groups or substructures.

3. **Molecular weight cutoff**: While tetrasaccharides typically have a molecular weight greater than 600 Da, this cutoff may be too strict and exclude smaller tetrasaccharides or include larger oligosaccharides.

4. **Carbon and oxygen count**: The criteria for carbon and oxygen counts may be too strict or too lenient, leading to incorrect classifications.

To improve the program, here are some potential solutions:

1. **Use more specific substructure patterns**: Instead of relying solely on ring counts and generic patterns like O-C-O, use more specific substructure patterns to identify monosaccharide units and glycosidic bonds. This can be done by using SMARTS patterns or predefined substructure matching functions from RDKit.

2. **Incorporate additional structural features**: Consider incorporating additional structural features specific to tetrasaccharides, such as the presence of specific monosaccharide units, stereochemistry, or specific linkage patterns.

3. **Use machine learning or rule-based approaches**: Instead of relying solely on hard-coded rules, consider training a machine learning model or developing a more comprehensive rule-based system using a larger dataset of tetrasaccharide and non-tetrasaccharide examples.

4. **Refine thresholds and criteria**: Refine the thresholds and criteria for molecular weight, atom counts, and other properties based on a larger dataset of tetrasaccharides and non-tetrasaccharides.

5. **Handle exceptional cases**: Identify and handle exceptional cases or edge cases that may violate the assumptions or rules used in the program.

6. **Use external databases or resources**: Consider using external databases or resources that provide curated information on tetrasaccharides and their structures, which can be used for validation or as training data.

Overall, while the previous program made a reasonable attempt at classifying tetrasaccharides, its performance was limited by the assumptions and simplistic rules used. Incorporating more specific structural patterns, additional features, and potentially machine learning or rule-based approaches could improve the accuracy of the classification.
