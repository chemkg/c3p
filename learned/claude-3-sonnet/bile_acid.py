"""
Classifies: CHEBI:3098 bile acid
"""
The previous program made a reasonable attempt at identifying bile acids, but it had some issues that led to a low F1 score. Let's analyze the outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

Missed True Positives:
- The program correctly identified the presence of the cholanic acid backbone, but failed to recognize some true bile acid structures due to additional constraints.

Potential Issues:
1. The cholanic acid backbone pattern may be too specific, missing variations in the tetracyclic structure or stereochemistry.
2. The requirement for a carboxyl group may be too strict, as some bile acids can have other functional groups (e.g., ketones, alcohols) instead of a carboxyl group.
3. The optional amide linkage check may be too narrow, missing other potential modifications or conjugations.
4. The molecular weight range check may be too restrictive or not account for different conjugations or modifications.

Improvements:
1. Relax the cholanic acid backbone pattern to account for more structural variations and stereochemical configurations.
2. Allow for other functional groups or modifications besides the carboxyl group.
3. Expand the check for amide linkages or other conjugations to include a broader range of possibilities.
4. Adjust the molecular weight range or remove it entirely, as it may not be a reliable indicator for all bile acids.
5. Consider additional checks for common structural features or substructures found in bile acids, such as ring systems, oxidation patterns, or specific functional group arrangements.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to use a combination of substructure matching and machine learning techniques to improve the classification accuracy. This could involve training a model on a larger dataset of bile acid structures and using it in conjunction with the existing substructure matching rules.
