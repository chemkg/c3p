"""
Classifies: CHEBI:47909 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroids by looking for specific substructure patterns in the SMILES string. However, the analysis of the outcomes revealed that it failed to identify many known examples of this class, leading to a high number of false negatives.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and ways to improve the program:

1. **Rigid substructure matching**: The program uses strict substructure matching to identify the steroid backbone and the functional groups. However, steroid structures can exhibit conformational flexibility, and the specific atom mappings used in the SMARTS patterns may not match all valid cases. To address this, the program could employ more flexible substructure matching techniques or consider using alternative representations like molecular fingerprints or descriptors.

2. **Incomplete substructure patterns**: The SMARTS patterns used in the program may not cover all possible variations of the steroid backbone and the required functional groups. For example, the steroid backbone pattern assumes a specific stereochemistry, which may not hold true for all cases. Additionally, the program does not account for potential variations in the position or orientation of the functional groups. To improve this, the program could use more general patterns or combine multiple patterns to cover a broader range of structures.

3. **Missing additional criteria**: The program only checks for the presence of the steroid backbone, the 3-oxo group, and the conjugated alpha,beta C=C bond. However, there may be additional structural or physicochemical criteria that define the class more precisely. For example, the program could incorporate checks for molecular weight, atom counts, or other descriptor-based filters to better discriminate between valid and invalid structures.

4. **Stereochemistry handling**: The program does not explicitly handle stereochemistry, which can be crucial for accurately identifying steroid structures. Some of the SMARTS patterns include stereochemical specifications, but these may not be sufficient to cover all cases. Improving stereochemistry handling by using appropriate tools or representations could enhance the accuracy of the classification.

5. **Insufficient training and validation**: The program's performance may suffer from a lack of sufficient training and validation data. It is essential to test the program on a diverse set of known positive and negative examples to identify and address any shortcomings in the classification logic.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the false negatives and false positives to identify patterns or structural features that the program is missing or misinterpreting.
2. Explore alternative representations or descriptors, such as molecular fingerprints or predefined descriptors, which may capture the structural features more effectively.
3. Incorporate additional criteria or filters based on physicochemical properties or descriptor values to better discriminate between valid and invalid structures.
4. Improve the handling of stereochemistry by using appropriate tools or representations.
5. Expand the training and validation dataset to cover a wider range of examples and iteratively refine the classification logic based on the observed outcomes.

By addressing these potential issues and continuously improving the program based on the analysis of misclassified examples, you can enhance the accuracy and robustness of the 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid classifier.
