"""
Classifies: CHEBI:22798 beta-D-glucoside
"""
The previous code attempted to classify beta-D-glucosides based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of a D-glucose substructure
2. Beta configuration at the anomeric center
3. Presence of a glucosidic bond (O-C)
4. Exactly 6 oxygen atoms

However, the program failed to correctly identify any true positives or negatives, indicating some issues with the approach.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Anomeric center detection**: The code attempts to find the anomeric center by looking for an oxygen atom with degree 2 and a neighboring carbon atom with degree 4. However, this approach may not be robust enough to handle all cases, especially in complex molecules.

    **Improvement**: Consider using a more sophisticated method to detect the anomeric center, such as using the `rdkit.Chem.FindMolChiralCenters` function or implementing a dedicated substructure search for the anomeric center pattern.

2. **Configuration determination**: The code uses the `_CIPCode` property to determine the configuration at the anomeric center. However, this property may not be set correctly for all molecules, especially if the molecule has not been properly sanitized or if there are issues with the stereochemistry perception.

    **Improvement**: Instead of relying on the `_CIPCode` property, consider using the `rdkit.Chem.AssignStereochemistry` function to ensure that the stereochemistry is correctly perceived and assigned.

3. **Glucosidic bond detection**: The code checks for the presence of a single bond between any atoms as an indicator of a glucosidic bond. However, this approach may be too broad and could lead to false positives.

    **Improvement**: Use a more specific substructure pattern to detect the glucosidic bond, such as `[O-][C@H]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)CO)O)O)O`, which matches the glucose moiety with an attached oxygen atom.

4. **Oxygen atom count**: Counting the number of oxygen atoms is a valid approach, but it may not be sufficient on its own to distinguish beta-D-glucosides from other molecules containing glucose-like substructures.

    **Improvement**: In addition to counting oxygen atoms, consider adding other structural checks, such as verifying the presence of specific functional groups or substructures commonly found in beta-D-glucosides.

5. **Stereochemistry handling**: The current code does not explicitly handle stereochemistry beyond the anomeric center. Beta-D-glucosides have specific stereochemistry requirements for the other chiral centers in the glucose moiety.

    **Improvement**: Incorporate checks for the correct stereochemistry at all chiral centers in the glucose moiety, using either substructure pattern matching or explicit stereochemistry perception and validation.

By addressing these issues and potentially incorporating additional structural checks or constraints, you may be able to improve the accuracy and robustness of the `is_beta_D_glucoside` function.
