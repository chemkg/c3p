"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23824 diol
"""
The previous program aimed to classify compounds as diols based on the presence of exactly two hydroxy (-OH) groups and a molecular weight below 500 Da. It also included a check for restricted functional groups like aldehydes and ketones, which should not be present in diols.

However, the outcomes show that this approach has several limitations:

1. **Molecular Weight Cutoff**: The molecular weight cutoff of 500 Da was too strict, leading to false negatives for larger diol molecules like ajugamarin A1 chlorohydrin, fellutamide C, fumitremorgin A, 3,15-di-O-acetylbruceolide, and artemoin D. These compounds contain two hydroxy groups but were incorrectly classified due to their high molecular weight.

2. **Restricted Functional Groups**: The check for restricted functional groups like aldehydes and ketones was too strict, leading to false negatives for compounds like 3-[(5S,6R)-5,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,3-dienyl]acrylic acid, resolvin E2, and 2-Fluorocyclohexadiene-cis,cis-1,2-diol-1-carboxylate, which contain both hydroxy groups and carbonyl groups but are still considered diols.

3. **Overcounting Hydroxy Groups**: The program only counted the number of hydroxy groups and did not consider their connectivity or position within the molecule. This led to false positives for compounds like selenic acid, 9alpha-Fluoro-6alpha-methylprednisolone 21-acetate, and (5R,7S)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromen-4-one, which contain two oxygen atoms but are not diols.

4. **Stereochemistry**: The program did not consider stereochemistry, which can be important for identifying specific diol isomers.

To improve the program, the following modifications could be made:

1. **Relax Molecular Weight Cutoff**: Remove the strict molecular weight cutoff or increase it to a higher value to accommodate larger diol molecules.

2. **Refine Functional Group Restrictions**: Instead of excluding all compounds with carbonyl groups, consider allowing specific patterns or substructures that are known to occur in diols, such as cyclic structures with both hydroxy and carbonyl groups.

3. **Improve Hydroxy Group Identification**: Instead of simply counting the number of hydroxy groups, use more sophisticated substructure matching or pattern recognition techniques to identify the connectivity and position of the hydroxy groups within the molecule.

4. **Consider Stereochemistry**: Incorporate stereochemical information by using appropriate SMARTS patterns or by considering the 3D structure of the molecule, if available.

5. **Use Machine Learning**: Alternatively, consider using a machine learning approach to train a model on a large dataset of known diols and non-diols, allowing the model to learn the relevant patterns and features for accurate classification.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating more advanced techniques, the accuracy of the diol classification program can be significantly improved.
