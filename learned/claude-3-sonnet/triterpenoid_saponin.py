"""
Classifies: CHEBI:61778 triterpenoid saponin
"""
The previous program attempted to classify triterpenoid saponins based on the presence of a triterpenoid backbone and attached sugar groups, as well as molecular weight and atomic composition criteria. However, the outcomes show that this approach was not successful, as it missed many known triterpenoid saponin structures.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Triterpenoid backbone pattern:** The SMARTS pattern used to detect the triterpenoid backbone may be too specific or too restrictive. Triterpenoid backbones can have various structural variations, including different stereochemistry and ring fusion patterns. Using a more general pattern or a set of patterns may improve the detection of diverse triterpenoid backbones.

2. **Sugar group pattern:** The SMARTS pattern used to detect sugar groups may also be too specific. Saponins can have different types of sugar moieties (e.g., glucose, galactose, rhamnose) attached in various configurations. Expanding the set of patterns to cover more sugar group variations could improve detection.

3. **Molecular weight and atomic composition criteria:** While these criteria can be useful, relying too heavily on them may exclude valid structures that fall outside the specified ranges. It might be better to use these criteria as supporting evidence rather than strict requirements.

4. **Multistep approach:** Instead of attempting to classify triterpenoid saponins in a single step, a multistep approach could be more effective. This could involve first identifying the triterpenoid backbone, then detecting the presence of sugar groups, and finally applying additional filters or criteria.

5. **Substructure-based classification:** Another approach could be to identify specific triterpenoid backbones and sugar groups present in known triterpenoid saponins and use these as substructure patterns for classification. This would require a more comprehensive set of substructure patterns but could potentially be more accurate.

6. **Machine learning-based approach:** If a large dataset of triterpenoid saponin structures is available, a machine learning-based approach could be explored. This would involve training a model on the known structures and using it to classify new structures.

To improve the program, it would be beneficial to analyze a larger set of known triterpenoid saponin structures and study their structural diversity. This could inform the development of more robust patterns, criteria, or a multistep approach. Additionally, exploring alternative approaches, such as substructure-based classification or machine learning, could be worthwhile if the resources are available.
