"""
Classifies: CHEBI:24128 furanocoumarin
"""
The previous program attempted to classify furanocoumarins by checking for the presence of a furan ring, a coumarin ring, a fused ring system, ether or ester groups, and a molecular weight within a typical range. However, based on the outcomes, it seems that the program failed to correctly identify many true furanocoumarins.

Here are some potential issues and improvements to consider:

1. **Furan and coumarin ring patterns**: The SMARTS patterns used to identify the furan and coumarin rings may be too specific or not accounting for all possible variations. It might be better to use more general patterns or a combination of patterns to capture different ring substitution patterns.

2. **Fused ring system detection**: The method used to detect fused ring systems (counting aromatic and aliphatic rings and subtracting the total number of rings) may not be robust enough. It might be better to explicitly check for ring fusion using substructure matching or other RDKit functionalities.

3. **Ether/ester group requirement**: While many furanocoumarins contain ether or ester groups, this requirement may be too strict. There could be examples of furanocoumarins without these functional groups, so this check should be relaxed or removed.

4. **Molecular weight range**: The molecular weight range used (200-600 Da) may be too narrow or inaccurate. It might be better to analyze the molecular weight distribution of known furanocoumarins and adjust the range accordingly.

5. **Additional structural features**: There may be other structural features or patterns that are characteristic of furanocoumarins but were not considered in the previous program. Analyzing the examples and incorporating additional checks for specific substructures or topological patterns could improve the classification accuracy.

6. **Machine learning approach**: Instead of using a rule-based approach, you could consider training a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, support vector machine) on a labeled dataset of furanocoumarins and non-furanocoumarins. This could potentially capture more complex patterns and improve the overall classification performance.

To improve the program, you could try the following steps:

1. Analyze the false negatives and true positives to identify common structural patterns or features that were missed or incorrectly used in the previous program.
2. Modify the SMARTS patterns or incorporate additional substructure checks to better capture the characteristic features of furanocoumarins.
3. Adjust or remove the molecular weight range check based on the analysis of known examples.
4. Consider incorporating additional checks for specific substructures or topological patterns that are common in furanocoumarins.
5. If a rule-based approach still struggles, explore the possibility of using a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of furanocoumarins and non-furanocoumarins.

By iteratively analyzing the failures and refining the program based on the structural characteristics of furanocoumarins, you should be able to improve the classification accuracy.
