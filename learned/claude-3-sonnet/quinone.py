"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36141 quinone
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as quinones by looking for a specific SMARTS pattern of a conjugated cyclic dione structure. However, the program had several limitations:

1. **Limited Pattern Matching**: The program only looked for two specific SMARTS patterns, which may not cover all possible quinone structures, particularly those with heterocycles or more complex ring systems.

2. **Tautomer Enumeration**: While the program attempted to enumerate tautomers, it did not handle the case where tautomer enumeration failed, potentially missing some valid quinone structures.

3. **Aromaticity Check**: The aromaticity check for the carbonyl groups was overly strict. It required the carbonyl oxygens to be in an aromatic ring or part of a 5- or 6-membered ring, which may exclude some valid quinone structures with larger or more complex ring systems.

4. **No Molecular Weight or Atom Count Checks**: The program did not include any checks for molecular weight or atom counts, which could help filter out molecules that are too small or too large to be valid quinones.

To improve the program, we can consider the following changes:

1. **Use a More Generalized SMARTS Pattern**: Instead of using specific patterns, we can use a more generalized SMARTS pattern that captures the essential features of a quinone, such as the presence of two carbonyl groups in a conjugated cyclic system.

2. **Handle Tautomer Enumeration Failures Gracefully**: Instead of simply ignoring tautomer enumeration failures, we can handle them gracefully by continuing with the original molecule or returning a specific error message.

3. **Relax the Aromaticity Check**: We can relax the aromaticity check to allow carbonyl groups in any conjugated cyclic system, not just those in aromatic rings or 5- or 6-membered rings.

4. **Include Molecular Weight and Atom Count Checks**: We can add checks for molecular weight and atom counts to filter out molecules that are too small or too large to be valid quinones.

5. **Consider Additional Structural Features**: We can consider additional structural features of quinones, such as the presence of aromatic rings, the number of rings, or the presence of specific substituents, to further refine the classification criteria.

With these improvements, the program should be better equipped to accurately classify quinone structures while maintaining a reasonable level of generalization.
