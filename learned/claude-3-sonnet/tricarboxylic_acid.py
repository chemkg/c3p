"""
Classifies: CHEBI:27093 tricarboxylic acid
"""
The previous program attempted to identify tricarboxylic acids by looking for three carboxyl groups (-COOH) and checking if they were connected to a common carbon backbone or ring. However, it appears that the approach had some limitations, as it failed to correctly classify the provided examples.

Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Handling different carboxyl group representations**: The program searched for the specific SMARTS pattern "[C](=O)(O)[OH]" to identify carboxyl groups. However, carboxyl groups can be represented in different ways in SMILES strings, such as "-C(=O)O" or "-C(O)=O". This could lead to missed cases where the carboxyl groups are represented differently.

   **Improvement**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern or multiple patterns to capture different representations of carboxyl groups.

2. **Identifying the common carbon backbone**: The program attempted to find a common carbon backbone or ring by checking the intersection of paths starting from the carbon atoms attached to the carboxyl groups. However, this approach might not work well for complex molecular structures or cases where the carboxyl groups are not directly attached to the carbon backbone.

   **Improvement**: Consider alternative methods for identifying the common carbon backbone, such as substructure matching or analyzing the molecular graph.

3. **Handling specific cases**: The provided examples included various molecular structures, some of which might not be easily captured by the general approach used in the previous program.

   **Improvement**: Analyze the examples that were missed and identify specific patterns or substructures that could be used to better classify tricarboxylic acids. This might involve additional SMARTS patterns or more specialized checks for certain molecular motifs.

4. **Molecular properties**: The program did not consider any additional molecular properties that could aid in the classification of tricarboxylic acids, such as molecular weight, number of atoms, or specific functional groups.

   **Improvement**: Incorporate additional checks for molecular properties that are characteristic of tricarboxylic acids, such as the presence of a certain number of carbon and oxygen atoms, or specific functional groups.

5. **Handling tautomers**: Some of the provided examples might be represented as tautomers, where the carboxyl groups are in the keto form (-C(=O)-O-) instead of the enol form (-C(=O)-OH).

   **Improvement**: Consider handling tautomers by either normalizing the SMILES strings or using SMARTS patterns that capture both tautomeric forms.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating additional checks and patterns specific to tricarboxylic acids, it should be possible to improve the classification accuracy of the program.
