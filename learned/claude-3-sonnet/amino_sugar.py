"""
Classifies: CHEBI:28963 amino sugar
"""
The previous program had a few issues that led to its failure in classifying amino sugars correctly:

1. **Substructure Pattern Limitations**: The program relied solely on the presence of an amino group and a sugar backbone pattern to classify a molecule as an amino sugar. However, this pattern may not be specific enough to capture all possible amino sugar structures, especially larger and more complex ones.

2. **Counting Amino and Hydroxy Groups**: The program counted the number of amino and hydroxy groups, but it did not check their connectivity or position within the molecule. It's possible for a molecule to have the required number of amino and hydroxy groups but not be an amino sugar because the amino group is not substituting a hydroxy group on the sugar backbone.

3. **Handling Complex Structures**: Many of the example structures provided are large and highly complex, with multiple sugar units linked together. The program's substructure pattern and counting approach may not be sufficient to handle such complex structures accurately.

To improve the program's performance, we could consider the following approaches:

1. **Utilize Existing Amino Sugar Definitions**: Instead of trying to define amino sugars from scratch, we could leverage existing definitions and structural patterns from resources like SMARTS patterns, molecular fingerprints, or substructure databases specifically designed for amino sugars.

2. **Incorporate Machine Learning**: For complex structural patterns, machine learning techniques like support vector machines (SVMs) or deep learning models could be employed. These models could be trained on a diverse set of amino sugar and non-amino sugar structures to learn the relevant structural features.

3. **Decompose Complex Structures**: For large and complex structures, we could attempt to break them down into smaller, more manageable substructures and analyze each component separately. This could involve identifying individual sugar units, their connectivity, and the presence of amino groups substituting hydroxy groups.

4. **Utilize Additional Molecular Descriptors**: The program could incorporate additional molecular descriptors beyond just the presence of functional groups, such as ring systems, connectivity, and stereochemistry, to better capture the structural features of amino sugars.

5. **Incorporate Expert Knowledge**: Collaborating with domain experts in carbohydrate chemistry or seeking guidance from scientific literature could provide valuable insights into defining more robust structural patterns or rules for identifying amino sugars.

It's important to note that accurately classifying complex chemical structures is a challenging task, and a combination of approaches, including domain knowledge, structural analysis, and machine learning techniques, may be required to achieve high accuracy.
