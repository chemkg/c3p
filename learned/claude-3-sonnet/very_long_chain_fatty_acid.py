"""
Classifies: CHEBI:27283 very long-chain fatty acid
"""
Let me analyze the issues with the previous code based on the outcomes:

1. Chain Length Calculation Issues:
- The code incorrectly missed several molecules that should be classified as VLCFAs (like docosahexaenoic acid derivatives)
- The chain length calculation function may be too strict or not handling certain structural features correctly
- We need to improve the chain length calculation to better handle branching and substitutions

2. False Positives:
- Many complex molecules with long chains but not true fatty acids were incorrectly classified
- Need better filtering for non-fatty acid structures
- Should add checks for:
  * Maximum number of hydroxyl groups (too many suggests a different class)
  * Maximum number of rings
  * Better handling of sugar/glycoside attachments
  * Better molecular weight limits

3. Molecular Weight Filter:
- The 1000 Da cutoff may be too high
- Some very complex molecules are getting through
- Should lower this threshold to ~600-700 Da for typical VLCFAs

4. Structure Validation:
- Need better validation that the overall structure matches fatty acid pattern
- Should check that the majority of the molecule is an aliphatic chain
- Better handling of allowed substitutions

Here's how I would improve the code:

1. Modify chain length calculation to:
- Better handle branching by following the longest path
- Include carbons in small rings as part of chain length
- Better handle substituted carbons

2. Add stricter fatty acid validation:
- Maximum number of hydroxyl groups (≤4)
- Maximum number of rings (≤3)
- Minimum proportion of carbons must be in main chain
- Better handling of allowed substitutions

3. Adjust thresholds:
- Lower molecular weight cutoff
- Stricter limits on number of heteroatoms
- Better ratio checks for C:O and C:H

4. Improve feature detection:
- Better distinction between main chain and substituents
- More accurate detection of fatty acid characteristic patterns
- Better handling of allowed modifications

Let me implement these improvements in the next response.
