"""
Classifies: CHEBI:134251 guaiacols
"""
The previous program attempted to classify guaiacols by looking for the guaiacol substructure pattern ("Oc1ccc(OC)cc1") and verifying the presence of exactly one methoxy and one hydroxyl group. It also checked the molecular weight range to be between 100-500 Da.

However, the outcomes show that this approach has some limitations:

1. **False Negatives**: The program missed several structures that are guaiacols but do not strictly match the guaiacol substructure pattern used. Examples include compounds with additional substituents on the phenol ring, or with the methoxy/hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic chains rather than the aromatic ring directly.

2. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified several non-guaiacol compounds as guaiacols, likely because they contain a phenol ring with a methoxy substituent, but not necessarily at the ortho position.

To improve the classification, we need to modify the approach to handle a broader range of guaiacol structures and more accurately identify the ortho-methoxy substitution pattern.

Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Use a more flexible substructure pattern**: Instead of looking for the exact guaiacol substructure, we can use a more general pattern that captures the essential features of a guaiacol (a phenol ring with an ortho-methoxy substituent), allowing for additional substituents or structural variations.

2. **Check the relative positions of methoxy and hydroxyl groups**: Rather than just counting the number of methoxy and hydroxyl groups, we should explicitly check their positions relative to each other on the phenol ring to ensure the methoxy group is at the ortho position.

3. **Consider additional structural features**: We may need to incorporate additional checks or filters based on other structural features commonly found in guaiacols, such as the presence of long aliphatic chains, ester groups, or specific substituent patterns.

4. **Use machine learning techniques**: If the structural rules become too complex, we could explore using machine learning techniques to classify guaiacols based on a training set of known examples.

5. **Improve molecular weight filtering**: The current molecular weight range may be too broad or too narrow, leading to incorrect classifications. We could refine the range based on a more extensive analysis of guaiacol structures.

By addressing these issues, we can develop a more robust and accurate program for classifying guaiacols based on their SMILES strings.
