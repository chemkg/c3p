Classifies: CHEBI:38077 polypyrrole
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as polypyrroles by checking if they contained at least two pyrrole rings. However, the code has a few issues:

1. The `IsNPyrroles` query checks for the presence of a specific number of pyrrole rings, but it does not ensure that these pyrrole rings are connected. As per the definition, a polypyrrole should have at least two pyrrole units connected together.

2. The code only checks for the presence of two pyrrole rings and returns True if found. However, it does not verify if there are more than two pyrrole units in the molecule, which is required for the polypyrrole classification.

3. The code does not account for other structural features that may be present in polypyrroles, such as the possibility of substitutions or additional ring systems connected to the pyrrole units.

To improve the program, we need to address these issues and develop a more comprehensive approach to identify polypyrroles. Here are some suggestions:

1. Instead of using the `IsNPyrroles` query, we can use the `MolFromSmarts` function to create a SMARTS pattern that represents two connected pyrrole rings.

2. Iterate over all possible matches of the SMARTS pattern in the molecule to identify individual polypyrrole fragments.

3. Keep track of the total number of pyrrole units found in the molecule by summing the lengths of the identified polypyrrole fragments.

4. Optionally, we can include additional checks for common substituents or ring systems that may be present in polypyrroles.

5. Classify the molecule as a polypyrrole if the total number of pyrrole units is greater than or equal to two, and if any additional structural constraints are satisfied.

By incorporating these improvements, the program should be better equipped to accurately identify polypyrroles based on their structural features.
