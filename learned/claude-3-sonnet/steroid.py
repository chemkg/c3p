"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35341 steroid
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it seems that the program is not able to correctly classify steroid molecules. The F1 score of 0 indicates that there are no true positives, and either all the predictions are false positives or false negatives.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene scaffold check**: The current approach of using the Murcko scaffold and SMARTS pattern may not be robust enough to correctly identify the steroid scaffold. It might be better to use a more specific substructure matching approach, such as checking for the presence of specific ring systems and fused rings.

2. **Methyl group check at C-10 and C-13**: The current approach of iterating through all rings and checking for two non-aromatic methyl groups may not be reliable. It might be better to use a more specific substructure matching approach, such as checking for the presence of specific atom environments or SMARTS patterns.

3. **Alkyl group check at C-17**: The current approach of checking for an atom with a degree greater than 3 may not be specific enough to identify the alkyl group at C-17. It might be better to use a more specific substructure matching approach, such as checking for the presence of a specific atom environment or SMARTS pattern.

4. **Molecular weight check**: The current range of 200-500 Da for molecular weight might be too broad or too narrow. It might be better to analyze a larger set of known steroid molecules and adjust the molecular weight range accordingly.

5. **Additional checks**: The current program only checks for the cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene scaffold, methyl groups at C-10 and C-13, an optional alkyl group at C-17, and molecular weight. However, there might be other structural features or properties that can help in better classifying steroid molecules, such as specific functional groups, stereochemistry, or ring fusion patterns.

6. **Training data**: It is possible that the program is not able to correctly classify steroid molecules because it was not trained on a sufficiently diverse and representative set of steroid structures. It might be helpful to gather a larger set of known steroid molecules and use them to refine the classification rules or develop a machine learning model.

To improve the program, you could try the following:

1. Implement a more robust substructure matching approach for identifying the cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene scaffold, methyl groups at C-10 and C-13, and the alkyl group at C-17 using specific SMARTS patterns or atom environments.
2. Analyze a larger set of known steroid molecules to refine the molecular weight range or identify other structural features or properties that can aid in classification.
3. Consider developing a machine learning model using a diverse set of training data for steroid and non-steroid molecules, and use it in conjunction with the rule-based approach.
4. Incorporate additional checks or filters based on other structural features or properties that are characteristic of steroid molecules.

By addressing these potential issues and iteratively refining the classification rules or developing a machine learning model, you should be able to improve the performance of the program in classifying steroid molecules.
