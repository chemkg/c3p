"""
Classifies: CHEBI:10283 2-hydroxy fatty acid
"""
The previous program attempted to identify 2-hydroxy fatty acids by looking for the following patterns:

1. A carboxylic acid group (-C(O)=O)
2. A hydroxy group (-OH) in the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylic acid group
3. A long carbon chain (fatty acid) with potential double bonds

However, the program failed to correctly classify many of the provided examples, as evidenced by the low F1 score and the false negatives listed in the outcomes.

Here are a few potential reasons for the program's failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Missed 2-hydroxy group detection**: The program only checks for a hydroxy group in the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylic acid group. However, some of the examples have the hydroxy group in the 2-position, which may not necessarily be the alpha or beta position. To address this, the program should check for a hydroxy group specifically in the 2-position of the fatty acid chain.

2. **Lack of stereochemistry consideration**: Some examples include stereochemistry information (e.g., `(R)` or `(S)` prefixes), which the current program does not account for. This could lead to false negatives for molecules with specific stereochemistry.

3. **Incomplete fatty acid chain pattern**: The fatty acid chain pattern `[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]` may not be sufficient to capture all possible fatty acid chains, especially those with long chains or multiple double bonds.

4. **Potential false positives**: The program does not explicitly check if the identified hydroxy group is part of the fatty acid chain or a separate functional group. This could lead to false positives for molecules with a hydroxy group not directly attached to the fatty acid chain.

To improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically look for a hydroxy group in the 2-position of the fatty acid chain, relative to the carboxylic acid group.
2. Consider incorporating stereochemistry information into the SMARTS pattern or using additional checks to account for stereochemistry.
3. Refine the fatty acid chain pattern to better capture longer chains and molecules with multiple double bonds.
4. Implement additional checks to ensure that the hydroxy group is part of the fatty acid chain and not a separate functional group.
5. Consider using additional structural features or properties (e.g., molecular weight, atom counts, etc.) to further refine the classification criteria.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating the necessary modifications, the program's accuracy in classifying 2-hydroxy fatty acids should improve significantly.
