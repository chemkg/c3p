"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18254 ribonucleoside
"""
The previous code attempted to classify ribonucleosides by checking for the presence of a ribose sugar moiety, a nucleobase (pyrimidine, imidazole, or purine), and a glycosidic bond connecting the two. However, it seems that the approach was too general and did not account for some specific features of ribonucleosides.

The outcomes show that the code missed all the true positive examples, suggesting that the patterns used to identify the ribose sugar and the glycosidic bond were not specific enough. Additionally, the code did not consider other characteristics of ribonucleosides, such as the stereochemistry or the presence of specific functional groups.

To improve the classification, we need to refine the patterns and add additional checks to ensure that we correctly identify ribonucleosides. Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Ribose sugar pattern**: Instead of using a general pattern for a 5-membered ring with hydroxyl groups, use a more specific pattern that captures the stereochemistry of the D-ribose sugar. For example, the SMARTS pattern `[C@H]1([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)O)O)O)O)` represents the D-ribose sugar with the correct stereochemistry.

2. **Glycosidic bond pattern**: The previous pattern for the glycosidic bond was too general and could match other types of bonds. Consider using a more specific pattern that explicitly matches the N-glycosidic bond between the ribose and the nucleobase. For example, the SMARTS pattern `[C@H]1([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)O)O)O)O)[nr3r5,nr5r5,nr5r6]` captures the N-glycosidic bond between the D-ribose and a nucleobase.

3. **Nucleobase pattern**: The previous code used a general pattern for nucleobases, but it might be better to use specific patterns for each type of nucleobase (purine, pyrimidine, etc.) to improve accuracy.

4. **Additional checks**: Consider adding additional checks for functional groups or substituents that are commonly found in ribonucleosides, such as hydroxyl groups, phosphate groups, or specific substituents on the nucleobase.

5. **Molecular weight and atom count checks**: Ribonucleosides typically fall within a certain range of molecular weights and have specific atom counts (e.g., a certain number of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms). Adding checks for these properties can help filter out false positives.

By incorporating these improvements, the classification accuracy for ribonucleosides should increase significantly. However, it's important to note that some edge cases or rare ribonucleosides might still be missed, and manual curation or additional rules might be necessary for a comprehensive classification.
