"""
Classifies: CHEBI:59845 3-hydroxy fatty acid
"""
The previous code attempted to identify 3-hydroxy fatty acids by looking for a specific SMARTS pattern for the hydroxy group at the 3-position, a carboxylic acid group, and a main aliphatic chain with the hydroxy group attached to it.

However, the error message suggests that the function `rdMolDescriptors.GetLipidChainDescriptors` is not available in the RDKit version being used. This function was likely intended to identify the main aliphatic chain in the molecule.

To improve the code, we can use alternative methods to identify the main aliphatic chain and the position of the hydroxy group relative to the carboxylic acid group.

Here's a revised approach:
