"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25106 macrolide
"""
The previous code attempted to classify macrolides based on the following properties:

1. Presence of a macrocyclic ring (â‰¥ 12 atoms)
2. Presence of a lactone group
3. Structural features suggesting a polyketide origin (long carbon chains, carbonyl groups)

However, the provided outcomes indicate that the program failed to correctly classify any molecules as macrolides or non-macrolides (no true positives, false positives, or false negatives).

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Lactone pattern mismatch**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify lactone groups (`[C@H]1[C@@]([C@@H](C(=O)O1))(O)`) may be too specific and might miss other lactone representations. Consider using a more general pattern or multiple patterns to cover different lactone motifs.

2. **Polyketide origin estimation**: The criteria used to estimate polyketide origin (number of carbons, oxygens, and carbonyls) may be too rigid or inaccurate. Some macrolides may not meet these criteria, or non-macrolides might fulfill them. Consider incorporating more specific structural patterns or rules to better identify polyketide-derived structures.

3. **Ring size constraint**: The requirement for a macrocyclic ring of at least 12 atoms may be too strict. Some macrolides might have smaller ring sizes, while other non-macrolide compounds could have larger rings. Consider adjusting or removing this constraint, and rely more on the lactone and polyketide origin criteria.

4. **Test data**: It is possible that the provided test data did not contain any valid macrolide structures, leading to the failure to identify true positives. Ensure that the test data includes a diverse set of macrolide and non-macrolide examples.

5. **Additional structural features**: Macrolides often exhibit specific structural features, such as sugar moieties, alkyl side chains, or other functional groups. Incorporating these features into the classification rules could improve accuracy.

To improve the program, consider the following steps:

1. Analyze a diverse set of macrolide and non-macrolide structures to identify common patterns and structural motifs.
2. Refine the SMARTS patterns used to identify lactone groups and polyketide-derived structures.
3. Adjust or remove the ring size constraint if it proves too restrictive.
4. Incorporate additional structural features specific to macrolides, such as sugar moieties or alkyl side chains.
5. Test the program with a diverse set of molecules, including known macrolides and non-macrolides, to evaluate its performance and make further adjustments as needed.

By iteratively refining the classification rules and testing against a diverse set of examples, the accuracy of the macrolide classification program can be improved.
