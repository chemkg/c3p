"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25106 macrolide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as macrolides based on the presence of a macrocyclic ring with 12 or more atoms, a lactone group, and a polyketide-derived structure. However, based on the outcomes provided, it appears that the program missed several true positives, likely due to the following issues:

1. **Lactone group detection**: The program only checks for a handful of specific lactone patterns using SMARTS patterns. However, macrolides can have more complex lactone groups or variations that are not covered by these patterns. The program should use a more robust method to detect lactone groups, such as identifying the specific lactone ring atoms and ensuring they are part of the macrocyclic ring.

2. **Macrocyclic ring detection**: The program checks for the presence of any macrocyclic ring with 12 or more atoms, but it does not ensure that the lactone group is part of this macrocyclic ring. It should explicitly check that the lactone ring atoms are part of the macrocyclic ring.

3. **Polyketide-derived structure check**: The criteria used to determine if a structure is polyketide-derived (number of carbons, oxygens, and carbonyls) may be too simplistic or not specific enough. Some macrolides may not meet these criteria, or other molecules that are not macrolides may satisfy them.

To improve the program, consider the following steps:

1. **Robust lactone group detection**: Instead of using SMARTS patterns, identify the specific lactone ring atoms by looking for a cyclic ester (a ring containing both a carbonyl and an ether oxygen). This can be done by iterating over the rings in the molecule and checking for these conditions.

2. **Macrocyclic lactone ring check**: After identifying the lactone ring atoms, ensure that they are part of a macrocyclic ring with 12 or more atoms. This can be done by checking the size of the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) that contains the lactone ring atoms.

3. **Polyketide-derived structure check (optional)**: Instead of relying on simple counts of atoms, consider using more specific structural features or substructure patterns to identify polyketide-derived structures. This may involve manually curating a set of SMARTS patterns or developing a machine learning model trained on known examples.

4. **Handling special cases**: Some macrolides may have additional or unusual structural features that require special handling. Consider adding exceptions or specific checks for known classes of macrolides that may not be covered by the general rules.

By addressing these issues, the program should be able to more accurately classify macrolides based on their SMILES strings.
