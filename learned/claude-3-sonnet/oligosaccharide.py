Classifies: CHEBI:50699 oligosaccharide

The error "type object 'Mol' has no attribute 'GetNumAtomsSplitByConnectedComponent'" suggests that the method `GetNumAtomsSplitByConnectedComponent` is not a valid method for the `Mol` object in RDKit. It seems that the previous code was attempting to use this method to check if the molecule consisted of a single connected component, which was used as a simplistic criterion to determine if it was a defined oligosaccharide structure or a mixture/polymer.

To improve the program, we need to find an alternative way to check for a defined structure, or refine the criteria for classification. Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Improve the monosaccharide pattern**: The current pattern (`[C@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]1O)O)O)O`) only matches hexose monosaccharides. We could extend the pattern to include other common monosaccharides like pentoses, deoxysugars, and amino sugars.

2. **Refine the glycosidic bond pattern**: The current pattern (`[OX2][CR]`) may match oxygen atoms that are not involved in glycosidic bonds. We could improve the pattern to be more specific, e.g., by considering the connectivity and environment of the oxygen atom.

3. **Consider other structural features**: Instead of relying solely on molecular weight and the number of connected components, we could look for other structural features that are characteristic of oligosaccharides, such as the presence of multiple glycosidic bonds, the absence of other functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines), or the presence of specific monosaccharide sequences.

4. **Use a different approach**: Instead of relying on SMARTS patterns and structural features, we could explore other approaches such as machine learning models trained on a dataset of known oligosaccharides and non-oligosaccharides.

5. **Improve the reasoning for classification**: The current reason for classification ("Contains multiple monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic linkages in a defined structure") could be made more specific and informative by providing details about the monosaccharide units, glycosidic linkages, and other structural features that led to the classification.

Overall, the previous program provides a good starting point, but there is room for improvement in the patterns, structural features, and reasoning used for classification. Addressing these areas could lead to a more robust and accurate oligosaccharide classifier.
