"""
Classifies: CHEBI:46874 alpha-amino acid ester
"""
The previous code attempts to classify molecules as alpha-amino acid esters by checking for the presence of an alpha-amino acid backbone and an ester group, and ensuring that the ester group is attached to the backbone.

However, the code has a few limitations that could lead to the poor performance observed:

1. **Limited Structural Pattern Recognition**: The code only checks for a specific pattern of an alpha-amino acid backbone and an ester group. However, alpha-amino acid esters can have various structural variations, such as different substituents, cyclic structures, or additional functional groups. The code may fail to recognize these variations, leading to false negatives.

2. **Lack of Molecular Properties Checks**: The code does not consider other molecular properties that could be useful in classifying alpha-amino acid esters, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or specific functional group patterns.

3. **Potential False Positives**: The code may classify molecules as alpha-amino acid esters even if the ester group is not directly attached to the alpha-amino acid backbone. This could lead to false positives.

To improve the performance of the program, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Expand Pattern Recognition**: Use more flexible and comprehensive SMARTS patterns to capture a wider range of structural variations. You could also consider using a combination of multiple patterns to increase coverage.

2. **Incorporate Molecular Properties**: Include checks for molecular properties that are characteristic of alpha-amino acid esters, such as molecular weight ranges, specific atom counts (e.g., number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms), and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, amine).

3. **Refine Ester Group Attachment Check**: Enhance the logic for checking the attachment of the ester group to the alpha-amino acid backbone. This could involve more precise bond tracing or the use of additional patterns to ensure the ester group is directly connected to the correct position.

4. **Utilize Machine Learning Approaches**: If the structural complexity of alpha-amino acid esters is too high for rule-based approaches, you could explore machine learning techniques. These techniques can learn patterns and features from labeled data, potentially providing better classification performance.

5. **Gather More Data and Validate**: Obtain a larger and more diverse dataset of alpha-amino acid esters and non-esters for training and validation purposes. This will help in identifying potential biases or limitations in the classification approach.

Overall, addressing the limitations in pattern recognition, incorporating additional molecular properties, and refining the logic for ester group attachment could lead to improved classification performance for alpha-amino acid esters.
