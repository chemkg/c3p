"""
Classifies: CHEBI:46874 alpha-amino acid ester
"""
The previous code attempts to classify a molecule as an alpha-amino acid ester by checking for the presence of an alpha-amino acid backbone and an ester group connected to the alpha carbon. It also checks for molecular properties like molecular weight, number of atoms, and number of rotatable bonds to fall within typical ranges for alpha-amino acid esters.

However, the code falls short in some cases, as evident from the outcomes provided. Here's an analysis of what went wrong and how we can improve:

1. **Missed positive cases**: Several structures that are indeed alpha-amino acid esters were not classified correctly. This could be due to the limitations of the SMARTS patterns used or the molecular property ranges being too narrow.

2. **Lack of specificity**: The current approach only checks for the presence of an alpha-amino acid backbone and an ester group, but it does not ensure that the ester group is specifically derived from an alcohol. This could lead to false positives, where other types of esters are incorrectly classified as alpha-amino acid esters.

3. **Molecular property ranges**: The ranges used for molecular weight, number of atoms, and number of rotatable bonds may be too restrictive or not well-suited for the diverse set of alpha-amino acid esters.

To improve the classification, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Analyze positive cases**: Carefully examine the structures of the missed positive cases and identify any recurring patterns or structural features that were not captured by the current SMARTS patterns or property ranges.

2. **Refine SMARTS patterns**: Based on the analysis of positive cases, refine the SMARTS patterns to better capture the structural features of alpha-amino acid esters. Consider using more specific patterns to ensure the ester group is derived from an alcohol.

3. **Adjust molecular property ranges**: Re-evaluate the molecular property ranges by analyzing a larger dataset of alpha-amino acid esters. Adjust the ranges to be more inclusive while still providing reasonable boundaries for the classification.

4. **Incorporate additional checks**: Consider incorporating additional checks or rules to further improve specificity. For example, you could check for the presence of a specific alcohol moiety or ensure that the alpha-amino acid backbone is connected to the ester group in a specific way.

5. **Ensemble approach**: If the classification task remains challenging, consider an ensemble approach where multiple methods or classifiers are combined to improve the overall performance.

By addressing these issues and refining the approach, the classification of alpha-amino acid esters can be improved, leading to better accuracy and fewer missed cases.
