"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35757 monocarboxylic acid anion
"""
The previous code attempted to identify monocarboxylic acid anions by checking for the presence of exactly one carboxylate anion group (-C(=O)[O-]) and the absence of any intact carboxy groups (-C(=O)OH). However, the outcomes show that this approach missed several examples of monocarboxylic acid anions.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Missed deprotonated carboxy groups**: The code only checks for the specific SMARTS pattern "C(=O)[O-]" for carboxylate anions. However, some examples like "2-dehydro-D-gluconate" have the carboxylate group represented differently (e.g., OC(=O)C([O-])=O). The SMARTS pattern should be more flexible to capture these variations.

2. **Presence of other functional groups**: The code assumes that the presence of a single carboxylate group is sufficient to classify a molecule as a monocarboxylic acid anion. However, some examples like "5-nitroanthranilate" contain additional functional groups (e.g., nitro groups), which were not accounted for.

3. **Lack of context-specific checks**: The code does not consider the specific context of the monocarboxylic acid anion, such as the presence of a hydrocarbon chain or a ring system. This led to false negatives like "chlorimuron," which does not have a carboxylate group.

To improve the program, the following modifications could be made:

1. **Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern**: Instead of a fixed SMARTS pattern, use a more flexible pattern that captures different representations of carboxylate groups. For example, "[CX3](=[OX1])[OX2-]" would match deprotonated carboxy groups with various substitution patterns.

2. **Include additional checks for functional groups**: Incorporate checks for the presence of other functional groups that are commonly found in monocarboxylic acid anions, such as hydroxy groups or alkyl chains.

3. **Implement context-specific checks**: Add checks for the presence of a hydrocarbon chain or a ring system, as these are typical structural features of monocarboxylic acid anions.

4. **Consider molecular properties**: Incorporate additional checks based on molecular properties, such as molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or topological polar surface area, which can help differentiate monocarboxylic acid anions from other chemical classes.

By addressing these issues and incorporating more specific checks, the program should be able to better classify monocarboxylic acid anions while reducing false negatives and false positives.
