"""
Classifies: CHEBI:38757 isoflavones
"""
The previous program attempts to classify isoflavones by checking for the presence of the 3-aryl-4H-chromen-4-one skeleton and other structural features such as aromatic rings, carbonyl groups, heterocyclic oxygens, and aryl substituents. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The SMARTS pattern used to match the isoflavone skeleton (`"c1coc2c(c1=O)c(ccc2)-c1ccccc1"`) is too specific and will miss many valid isoflavone structures. The pattern requires a particular substitution pattern and does not account for other possible substituents or rearrangements of the skeleton.

2. The program checks for the presence of a single aromatic ring, a single carbonyl group, a single heterocyclic oxygen, and a single aryl substituent. While isoflavones must have these features, the program does not account for the possibility of additional substituents or functional groups, which are common in many isoflavone derivatives.

3. The program does not consider other important structural features of isoflavones, such as the presence of a fused benzopyran ring system and the position of the aryl substituent relative to the pyran ring.

To improve the classification, a more flexible and comprehensive approach is needed. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use a more general SMARTS pattern or a series of patterns to match the core isoflavone skeleton, allowing for various substitution patterns.

2. Instead of checking for the exact number of specific functional groups, consider checking for the presence of these groups within a reasonable range (e.g., 1-3 carbonyl groups, 1-2 heterocyclic oxygens, etc.).

3. Implement additional checks for the presence of the fused benzopyran ring system and the correct positioning of the aryl substituent relative to the pyran ring.

4. Consider incorporating additional structural features or molecular descriptors that are characteristic of isoflavones, such as molecular weight, LogP, or specific substructure patterns.

5. Explore the use of machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or random forests, trained on a diverse set of isoflavone and non-isoflavone structures. These methods can learn complex patterns and may be more effective at identifying isoflavones than a rule-based approach.

By addressing these issues and incorporating more comprehensive structural checks or machine learning techniques, the classification accuracy for isoflavones is likely to improve significantly.
