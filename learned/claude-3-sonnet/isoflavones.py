"""
Classifies: CHEBI:38757 isoflavones
"""
The previous attempt failed because the program does not adequately capture the structural features of isoflavones. The outcomes show that the program did not correctly classify any molecules as isoflavones or non-isoflavones, indicating that the rules implemented in the code are either too strict or too permissive.

To improve the program, we need to carefully analyze the structural features of isoflavones and incorporate them into the code. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. The core feature of isoflavones is the presence of a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one (3-aryl-4H-chromen-4-one) skeleton. This part is correctly checked in the previous code using the SMARTS pattern `"[o,2]1[#6]:2:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:2:[#6]:1-[#6]1:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1"`.

2. However, the previous code does not check for the specific substitution pattern of isoflavones. According to the definition, isoflavones are "substituted derivatives" of the core skeleton. Typical substitutions include hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH3), and other substituents on the benzene rings and the heterocyclic ring.

3. The previous code checks for aromaticity, the presence of a carbonyl group, and a heterocyclic oxygen. While these are important features, they are not sufficient to distinguish isoflavones from other classes of compounds.

4. To improve the program, we need to add checks for the specific substitution patterns observed in isoflavones. This can be done using additional SMARTS patterns or by analyzing the atom environments and functional groups attached to the core skeleton.

5. Additionally, we may need to consider molecular properties such as molecular weight, number of rings, and other descriptors to further refine the classification rules.

6. It is also a good practice to include a set of known isoflavone structures and non-isoflavone structures as test cases to validate the program's performance and make iterative improvements.

In summary, the previous program fails because it does not adequately capture the structural features specific to isoflavones. To improve the program, we need to incorporate checks for the substitution patterns and potentially consider additional molecular descriptors and test cases.
