Classifies: CHEBI:25029 leukotriene
"""
The previous attempt failed to correctly classify leukotrienes, likely due to the following reasons:

1. **Checking for exactly 20 carbons**: While leukotrienes are derived from arachidonic acid, which has 20 carbons, some derivatives may have additional or fewer carbons. Checking for exactly 20 carbons is too restrictive.

2. **Counting conjugated double bonds incorrectly**: The function `CalcNumAromaticRings` is used to count conjugated double bonds, but this is incorrect. Leukotrienes do not have aromatic rings, and this function will not correctly identify the conjugated double bond system.

3. **Relying on specific SMARTS patterns**: The code checks for specific substructures like the carboxylic acid and alcohol groups at fixed positions. While this may work for some leukotrienes, it is too restrictive and will fail for derivatives or isomers with different substitution patterns.

4. **Molecular weight range**: The molecular weight range used (300-600 Da) may be too narrow, excluding some derivatives or isomers.

To improve the program, we should focus on more general structural features of leukotrienes instead of relying on fixed patterns or atom counts. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the conjugated double bond system using a more general SMARTS pattern.
2. Check for the presence of a carboxylic acid group and an alcohol group, without specifying their positions.
3. Optionally, check for common leukotriene substructures like the cysteinyl group, but do not rely solely on their presence.
4. Use a broader molecular weight range or avoid checking it altogether, as it may exclude valid derivatives.
5. Consider additional structural features like chain length, degree of unsaturation, or specific substituents if necessary.

By focusing on more general structural features and using flexible SMARTS patterns, the program should be better able to identify a broader range of leukotriene structures and their derivatives.
