"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33839 macromolecule
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, I can make the following observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Molecular Weight Cutoff**: The current cutoff of 1000 Da for molecular weight seems too low for macromolecules. Many of the false negatives (e.g., Potashchelin C, citrusoside A, Tenuecyclamide A) were classified as non-macromolecules due to their molecular weight being below 1000 Da. However, these molecules should still be considered macromolecules based on their structural complexity and repetitive units. A higher molecular weight cutoff, such as 2000 Da or even higher, should be considered.

2. **Repeating Substructure Detection**: The current approach of using a few pre-defined SMARTS patterns for peptides, saccharides, and polyketides is too simplistic and may miss many other types of repeating substructures. A more general and flexible approach is needed to detect repetitive units in a wider range of macromolecular structures.

3. **Ring Structure and Heteroatom Counts**: The current criteria for ring structure count (>= 3) and heteroatom count (>= 5) seem reasonable but may not be sufficient on their own to distinguish macromolecules from smaller, complex molecules. These criteria should be used in conjunction with other features and given appropriate weights.

4. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified several molecules with high molecular weights and some repeating substructures (e.g., LPS core oligosaccharide, glucosyl-(heptosyl)2-4-phosphoheptosyl-(KDO)2-lipid A) as macromolecules. Additional filters or criteria may be needed to avoid such false positives.

To improve the program, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Increase the molecular weight cutoff**: Start with a higher molecular weight cutoff, such as 2000 Da or higher, and adjust based on further testing and analysis.

2. **Implement a more robust method for detecting repeating substructures**: Instead of relying on pre-defined SMARTS patterns, consider using a more general approach to identify repetitive units within the molecular structure. This could involve techniques like maximum common substructure (MCS) detection, graph-based analysis, or other pattern recognition algorithms.

3. **Incorporate additional structural features**: In addition to molecular weight, repeating substructures, ring counts, and heteroatom counts, consider incorporating other structural features that may be indicative of macromolecules. These could include features like the presence of specific functional groups, the ratio of heavy atoms to heteroatoms, or the distribution of atom types and bond types.

4. **Use machine learning**: Given the complexity of the problem, a machine learning approach may be more effective than a rule-based approach. You could train a binary classifier (e.g., random forest, support vector machine) on a labeled dataset of macromolecules and non-macromolecules, using various molecular descriptors and structural features as input.

5. **Refine the dataset**: Carefully review the dataset, especially the false positives and false negatives, and ensure that the molecules are correctly labeled. This may involve consulting domain experts or literature to verify the classification of borderline cases.

6. **Improve the reasoning and explanation**: In addition to the binary classification, provide more detailed reasoning and explanation for the classification decisions. This could involve identifying the specific structural features or patterns that contributed to the classification, or providing a confidence score or probability estimate.

Overall, the task of accurately classifying macromolecules based on their SMILES strings is challenging and may require a combination of domain knowledge, advanced pattern recognition techniques, and machine learning approaches. Iterative refinement of the dataset, features, and algorithms will be crucial for improving the performance of the classification system.
