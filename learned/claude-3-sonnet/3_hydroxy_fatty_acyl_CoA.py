"""
Classifies: CHEBI:20060 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program makes a good attempt at classifying 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA molecules, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classifies molecules like sulfoacetyl-CoA as 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA because they contain the CoA moiety, a thioester bond, and a short carbon chain. However, these molecules do not have the required 3-hydroxy group on a fatty acid chain.

2. **False negatives**: The program misses many valid 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA molecules because it specifically checks for the thioester bond pattern "CCS(=O)". However, in many of the examples provided, the thioester bond is part of a larger substructure and not represented by that exact SMARTS pattern.

3. **Stereochemistry**: The program does not adequately account for stereochemistry. The 3-hydroxy group can have either R or S configuration, and the fatty acid chains can have varying degrees of unsaturation and cis/trans isomerism.

To improve the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. **Refine the CoA moiety check**: Instead of using a fixed SMARTS pattern, we can check for the presence of the CoA moiety by matching the molecular formula or specific substructures.

2. **Relax the thioester bond check**: Instead of looking for a specific SMARTS pattern, we can check for the presence of any thioester bond by identifying atoms with the appropriate connectivity and atom types.

3. **Improve the 3-hydroxy group check**: Instead of using a fixed SMARTS pattern, we can look for any carbon atom with a single hydroxyl group and two neighboring carbon atoms, accounting for stereochemistry.

4. **Enhance the fatty acid chain check**: We can refine the fatty acid chain check by looking for long carbon chains (e.g., at least 6 carbon atoms) with optional unsaturation and considering both linear and branched chains.

5. **Add additional checks**: We can include additional checks for molecular weight, atom counts, and other relevant properties to further improve the classification accuracy.

By implementing these changes, the program should be able to more accurately classify 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA molecules while reducing false positives and negatives.
