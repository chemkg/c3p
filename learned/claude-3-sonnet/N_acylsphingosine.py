"""
Classifies: CHEBI:52639 N-acylsphingosine
"""
The previous program attempted to classify N-acylsphingosines by looking for the following patterns:

1. A sphingosine backbone
2. An amide group (-N-C(=O)-) attached to the sphingosine backbone
3. A fatty acid chain attached to the amide group

It also checked for additional functional groups like hydroxyls and linoleoyl groups, and applied filters based on molecular weight and atom counts.

However, the program failed to correctly classify the provided examples. Upon analyzing the false negatives, I can identify a few issues:

1. The SMARTS pattern for the sphingosine backbone was too specific, only matching a particular chain length. N-acylsphingosines can have varying chain lengths.

2. The SMARTS pattern for the amide group was too restrictive, requiring a specific attachment point to the sphingosine backbone. N-acylsphingosines can have the amide group attached at different positions.

3. The program did not account for different stereochemistry and double bond configurations in the sphingosine backbone.

4. Some examples had additional functional groups like ester or ether linkages that were not accounted for in the program.

To improve the program, we need to address these issues. Specifically:

1. Use a more general SMARTS pattern for the sphingosine backbone to match varying chain lengths.
2. Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for the amide group, allowing different attachment points to the backbone.
3. Account for different stereochemistry and double bond configurations in the sphingosine backbone.
4. Allow for additional functional groups like esters and ethers in the molecule.
5. Adjust the molecular weight and atom count filters to accommodate a wider range of N-acylsphingosines.

With these improvements, the program should be able to correctly classify the provided examples and potentially other N-acylsphingosines with different structural variations.
