"""
Classifies: CHEBI:52639 N-acylsphingosine
"""
The previous program attempted to classify N-acylsphingosines by looking for the following key components:

1. Sphingosine backbone
2. Amide group (-N-C(=O)-) attached to the sphingosine backbone
3. Fatty acid chain attached to the amide group
4. Molecular weight and atom count filters

However, the program failed to correctly classify any of the provided examples. Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Sphingosine backbone pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to match the sphingosine backbone appears to be too specific and does not account for variations in the double bond position or stereochemistry. A more general pattern that captures the core sphingosine structure would be better.

2. **Amide group matching**: The amide pattern used matches any amide group, but it does not ensure that the amide is specifically attached to the sphingosine backbone. Additional checks may be needed to ensure the correct connectivity.

3. **Fatty acid chain matching**: The fatty acid pattern matches any linear carbon chain of at least 4 carbons, but it does not account for potential substitutions or functional groups on the fatty acid chain. A more flexible pattern or additional checks may be required.

4. **Molecular weight and atom count filters**: The filters used for molecular weight and atom counts may need to be adjusted based on the specific examples and their variations.

5. **Stereochemistry handling**: The program does not seem to handle stereochemistry correctly, which is important for distinguishing different isomers of N-acylsphingosines.

6. **Handling of additional functional groups**: Some examples contain additional functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups, linoleoyl groups) that the program does not account for.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the provided examples more carefully to understand the variations in structure and functional groups.
2. Modify the SMARTS patterns to be more flexible and account for the observed variations.
3. Implement additional checks to ensure the correct connectivity and positioning of the key components (sphingosine backbone, amide group, fatty acid chain).
4. Handle stereochemistry correctly, either by using appropriate SMARTS patterns or by explicitly checking atom stereochemistry.
5. Incorporate checks for additional functional groups or substitutions that are present in the examples.
6. Adjust the molecular weight and atom count filters based on the observed ranges in the examples.
7. Consider breaking down the classification into multiple steps or functions to handle different aspects of the structure separately.

By addressing these issues and carefully analyzing the provided examples, you should be able to improve the program's performance in classifying N-acylsphingosines.
