"""
Classifies: CHEBI:16412 lipopolysaccharide
"""
The previous code attempted to classify lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by looking for specific structural features: a trisaccharide repeating unit, oligosaccharide side chains, and a 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid unit. However, based on the outcomes, it appears that the code missed all the positive examples of lipopolysaccharides.

Here are a few possible reasons why the code failed and how it could be improved:

1. **Trisaccharide repeating unit pattern**: The patterns used to search for the trisaccharide repeating unit (two heptose units and octulosonic acid) may not be general enough to capture all possible variations. Lipopolysaccharides can have diverse structures, and the trisaccharide unit may not always conform to the exact patterns used in the code.

   **Improvement**: Study more examples of lipopolysaccharide structures and refine the trisaccharide unit patterns to account for structural variations.

2. **Oligosaccharide side chain pattern**: The pattern used to search for oligosaccharide side chains (`[OX2][CX4][OX2]`) is too general and may match unrelated structures.

   **Improvement**: Use a more specific pattern or a combination of patterns to better identify oligosaccharide side chains in the context of lipopolysaccharides.

3. **3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid unit pattern**: The pattern used to search for the 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid unit (`CCCCCCCCCCCCC[C@@H](O)C(O)=O`) is very specific and may not match variations in the lipid chain length or substitution patterns.

   **Improvement**: Use a more general pattern that can match different lipid chain lengths and substitution patterns, while still capturing the essential features of the 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid unit.

4. **Molecular weight filter**: The molecular weight filter of 2000 Da may be too strict, as some lipopolysaccharides may have lower molecular weights depending on their specific structures.

   **Improvement**: Adjust the molecular weight filter or remove it altogether if it is not a reliable criterion for classification.

5. **Structural complexity**: Lipopolysaccharides are complex molecules, and it may be challenging to capture all their structural features using a set of predefined patterns.

   **Improvement**: Explore machine learning approaches that can learn the structural patterns of lipopolysaccharides from a large dataset of examples, rather than relying on manually defined patterns.

Overall, the key to improving the classification of lipopolysaccharides would be to study a diverse set of examples, refine the structural patterns used for matching, and potentially explore machine learning techniques that can learn the structural features directly from data.
