"""
Classifies: CHEBI:16412 lipopolysaccharide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify lipopolysaccharides by looking for the following key structural features:

1. A trisaccharide repeating unit consisting of two heptose units and one octulosonic acid unit.
2. Oligosaccharide side chains.
3. A 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid unit or a related lipid chain.
4. A molecular weight greater than 1000 Da.

However, the outcomes show that the program failed to identify any true positives and missed all the provided examples of lipopolysaccharides.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Trisaccharide repeating unit pattern**:
   - The SMARTS patterns used to detect the trisaccharide repeating unit may be too specific or restrictive.
   - Lipopolysaccharides can have structural variations in the trisaccharide unit, such as different stereochemistry or modifications.
   - The program should consider more general patterns or a broader range of patterns to account for structural diversity.

2. **Oligosaccharide side chain pattern**:
   - The SMARTS pattern used to detect oligosaccharide side chains may be too simple or not specific enough.
   - Lipopolysaccharides can have complex and diverse side chain structures.
   - The program should consider more specific patterns or a combination of patterns to better identify the side chains.

3. **Lipid chain pattern**:
   - The SMARTS patterns used to detect the lipid chain may be too specific or restrictive.
   - Lipopolysaccharides can have different lengths and modifications in the lipid chain.
   - The program should consider more general patterns or a broader range of patterns to account for variations in the lipid chain.

4. **Molecular weight criterion**:
   - The molecular weight cutoff of 1000 Da may be too high or too low, depending on the specific lipopolysaccharide structures.
   - The program should consider a more flexible molecular weight range or use other structural features to determine the molecular weight criterion.

5. **Overall structural complexity**:
   - Lipopolysaccharides are structurally diverse and complex molecules.
   - The program may need to consider a combination of more sophisticated structural patterns and rules to accurately identify lipopolysaccharides.
   - Incorporating machine learning techniques or using more advanced cheminformatics tools could improve the classification performance.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the provided examples and identify common structural patterns or motifs that are characteristic of lipopolysaccharides.
2. Expand the set of SMARTS patterns to cover a broader range of structural variations in the trisaccharide repeating unit, oligosaccharide side chains, and lipid chains.
3. Experiment with different molecular weight ranges or use other structural features to determine a more appropriate molecular weight criterion.
4. Consider incorporating machine learning techniques or using more advanced cheminformatics tools to handle the structural complexity of lipopolysaccharides.
5. Validate the updated program with a larger and more diverse set of lipopolysaccharide structures to ensure improved classification performance.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating more structural diversity into the program, you may be able to improve the classification accuracy for lipopolysaccharides.
