"""
Classifies: CHEBI:87691 tetradecanoate ester
"""
From the provided outcomes, it appears that the previous program has a few issues:

1. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified several molecules as tetradecanoate esters, even though they did not contain a myristic acid substructure connected to an alcohol or phenol group via an ester bond. This is likely due to the program's criteria being too broad or not accounting for certain structural patterns.

2. **False Negatives**: The program missed some valid tetradecanoate esters, such as those where the myristic acid is connected to a carnitine or quaternary ammonium group instead of an alcohol or phenol. This is because the program specifically looks for alcohol or phenol groups, which is too restrictive.

3. **Lack of Specificity**: The program does not distinguish between different types of tetradecanoate esters (e.g., glycerides, phospholipids, carnitines, etc.). It simply checks for the presence of a myristic acid substructure, an ester bond, and an alcohol or phenol group, which may lead to false positives or false negatives for certain classes of compounds.

To improve the program, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Refine the Substructure Matching**: Instead of looking for a myristic acid substructure and an ester bond separately, consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that captures the entire tetradecanoate ester moiety. This could help reduce false positives.

2. **Broaden the Scope**: Instead of strictly looking for alcohol or phenol groups, consider including other common groups that can form tetradecanoate esters, such as amines (for carnitine esters), quaternary ammonium groups (for phospholipids), and glycerol backbones (for glycerides).

3. **Implement Class-Specific Checks**: If the goal is to classify specific classes of tetradecanoate esters (e.g., glycerides, phospholipids, carnitines), consider implementing separate checks or functions for each class. This could involve looking for characteristic substructures or patterns specific to each class, such as glycerol backbones for glycerides or phosphate groups for phospholipids.

4. **Refine Molecular Weight Checks**: The molecular weight check could be made more specific by considering the range of molecular weights for different classes of tetradecanoate esters. For example, glycerides and phospholipids tend to have higher molecular weights than carnitine esters.

5. **Consider Additional Descriptors**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or properties (e.g., number of rotatable bonds, ring counts, atom counts, etc.) to further refine the classification criteria and reduce false positives and false negatives.

By implementing these improvements, the program should become more robust and accurate in classifying tetradecanoate esters, while also providing the flexibility to distinguish between different classes of these compounds if desired.
