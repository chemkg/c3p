"""
Classifies: CHEBI:37554 fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program attempted to identify fatty acyl-CoA molecules by checking for the presence of the following key features:

1. Coenzyme A backbone
2. Thioester linkage (-C(=O)-S-)
3. Fatty acid chain (long carbon chain attached to the thioester)
4. Additional functional groups (optional, e.g., hydroxy, keto)
5. Molecular weight and rotatable bond count checks

However, the outcomes show that the program failed to identify any of the provided examples as true positives. Let's analyze the potential issues:

1. The coenzyme A backbone pattern might be too specific or not capturing all possible variations. Some examples might have slight structural differences that are not being recognized.

2. The thioester linkage pattern (-C(=O)-S-) might be too simple and not capturing all possible representations of the thioester bond in SMILES notation.

3. The fatty acid chain patterns might not be comprehensive enough to cover all possible chain lengths, branching patterns, and unsaturation patterns.

4. The molecular weight and rotatable bond count thresholds might be too strict or not suitable for all fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

5. There might be additional structural rules or constraints that are not being considered, leading to false negatives.

To improve the program, we can try the following:

1. Analyze the examples and identify variations in the coenzyme A backbone representation in SMILES. Modify the backbone pattern accordingly.

2. Explore alternative patterns or techniques to identify the thioester linkage more robustly.

3. Expand the set of fatty acid chain patterns to cover a wider range of possibilities, including longer chains, more unsaturation patterns, and branching patterns.

4. Adjust the molecular weight and rotatable bond count thresholds based on the provided examples and the general characteristics of fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

5. Analyze the examples carefully to identify any additional structural rules or constraints that might be necessary to accurately classify fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

6. Consider incorporating additional checks or patterns to handle specific cases or exceptions that might be present in the examples.

It's also possible that some of the provided examples might not strictly conform to the definition of fatty acyl-CoA or might have unusual structural features that make them challenging to classify correctly. In such cases, it might be necessary to refine the definition or add specific handling for those exceptional cases.

Overall, the key approach should be to iteratively analyze the examples, identify patterns and rules, and refine the program accordingly, until it can accurately classify the provided examples and potentially generalize well to other fatty acyl-CoA molecules.
