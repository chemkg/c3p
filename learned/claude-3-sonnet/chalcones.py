"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23086 chalcones
"""
The previous code attempted to classify chalcones by checking for the presence of the chalcone backbone pattern (Ar-CH=CH-C(=O)-Ar) and aromatic rings connected by an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. However, there are a few potential issues with this approach:

1. The SMARTS pattern used to match the chalcone backbone (`c1ccccc1C=CC(=O)c2ccccc2`) is too specific and will miss many chalcone derivatives with substituents on the aromatic rings.

2. The aromatic ring detection relies on the RingInfo class, which may not always identify fused or bridged rings correctly.

3. The code only checks for the presence of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, but does not verify that it is connecting the two aromatic rings.

4. The code does not consider other structural features or properties that could help differentiate chalcones from other molecules with similar substructures.

To improve the classification, we could try the following:

1. Use a more general SMARTS pattern to match the chalcone backbone, allowing for substituents on the aromatic rings.

2. Use a different method for identifying aromatic rings, such as the Chem.GetSSSR() function or the Chem.GetAromaticRings() function.

3. Explicitly check that the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone is connecting the two aromatic rings.

4. Consider additional properties or structural features that are characteristic of chalcones, such as the presence of specific substituents, molecular weight ranges, or other structural constraints.

5. Use a combination of multiple criteria to improve the accuracy of the classification, rather than relying on a single substructure match.

6. Test the program on a diverse set of chalcone and non-chalcone examples to evaluate its performance and adjust the criteria as needed.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating additional criteria, the classification program should be able to more accurately identify chalcones and their derivatives.
