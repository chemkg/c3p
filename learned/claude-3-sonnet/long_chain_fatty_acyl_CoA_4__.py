"""
Classifies: CHEBI:83139 long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
"""
The previous program attempted to classify long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules based on various criteria, such as the presence of the CoA backbone, the length of the fatty acid chain, the presence of a carboxylate group, the ester linkage between the fatty acid and CoA, and the overall charge of the molecule. It also checked for common structural features like double bonds, stereochemistry, hydroxyl groups, keto groups, and epoxide groups.

However, the program failed to correctly identify some of the provided examples, as indicated by the outcomes. Here's an analysis of what went wrong and some potential improvements:

1. **Missing CoA backbone**: The program relies heavily on the presence of the CoA backbone, as defined by the `coa_pattern` SMARTS pattern. However, this pattern may not accurately capture all possible variations of the CoA backbone structure. Some of the false negatives could be due to slight structural differences in the CoA backbone that are not accounted for by the current pattern.

   **Improvement**: Carefully examine the false negatives and refine the `coa_pattern` to accommodate any variations in the CoA backbone structure that were missed.

2. **Fatty acid chain length**: The program checks for a minimum length of the fatty acid chain by counting the number of carbon atoms and rotatable bonds. While this approach is reasonable, it may not be sufficient to capture all long-chain fatty acids accurately.

   **Improvement**: Consider additional criteria or adjust the thresholds for the number of carbon atoms and rotatable bonds to better classify long-chain fatty acids.

3. **Structural features**: The program checks for various structural features like double bonds, stereochemistry, hydroxyl groups, keto groups, and epoxide groups. However, it does not differentiate between these features being present in the fatty acid chain or elsewhere in the molecule.

   **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure that these structural features are specifically present in the fatty acid chain and not elsewhere in the molecule.

4. **Edge cases**: Some of the false negatives may be edge cases or exceptions that the program does not handle correctly. For example, there may be specific substituents or modifications that are not accounted for in the current implementation.

   **Improvement**: Carefully examine the false negatives and identify any edge cases or exceptions that need to be handled explicitly.

5. **Reason for classification**: The reason for classification provided by the program is based on the presence or absence of certain structural features. However, this reason may not accurately reflect the definition of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules, which is based on the deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate groups.

   **Improvement**: Revise the reason for classification to better align with the definition of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules, focusing on the deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate groups and the overall charge of the molecule.

By addressing these issues and improving the program's ability to accurately identify and classify long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules, you should be able to achieve a better F1 score and meet the desired performance criteria.
