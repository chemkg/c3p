"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33709 amino acid
"""
The previous program made a good attempt to classify amino acids based on their structural features, but there are a few areas where it could be improved:

1. **False positives**: The program is classifying some peptides (short sequences of amino acids) as amino acids, which is incorrect. It needs to have additional checks to filter out peptides.

2. **False negatives**: The program is missing some valid amino acids because of its strict structural constraints. For example, it is missing amino acids with modifications or substituents on the amino or carboxylic acid groups, as well as cyclic amino acids.

3. **Molecular weight check**: The molecular weight cutoff of 500 Da may be too low, as some amino acids with complex substituents or modifications can exceed this weight.

4. **Stereochemistry check**: The stereochemistry check using the `[C@H](N)(C(=O)O)[C@@H]` SMARTS pattern is too specific and will miss amino acids with different stereochemistry or those without explicit stereochemistry specified.

5. **Redundant checks**: Some of the checks, such as looking for specific functional groups like hydroxyl, thiol, or phosphate, may be unnecessary, as these groups can be present in valid amino acids.

To improve the program, we can take the following steps:

1. **Exclude peptides**: Add a check to exclude molecules containing more than one occurrence of the `C(C(=O)O)N` SMARTS pattern, which would indicate a peptide.

2. **Relax structural constraints**: Relax the constraints for additional functional groups and substituents on the amino and carboxylic acid groups, as well as cyclic structures. This can be achieved by removing or modifying the corresponding SMARTS patterns.

3. **Adjust molecular weight cutoff**: Increase the molecular weight cutoff to a higher value, such as 800 Da or more, to accommodate amino acids with complex substituents or modifications.

4. **Remove stereochemistry check**: Remove the stereochemistry check, as amino acids can have different stereochemistries, and the SMILES notation may not always specify stereochemistry explicitly.

5. **Remove unnecessary checks**: Remove the checks for specific functional groups like hydroxyl, thiol, or phosphate, as these groups can be present in valid amino acids.

6. **Consider additional checks**: Consider adding checks for common amino acid modifications or substituents, such as methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation, if desired.

By implementing these improvements, the program should be able to more accurately classify amino acids while reducing false positives and false negatives.
