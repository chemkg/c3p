Classifies: CHEBI:26333 prostaglandin
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as prostaglandins by looking for a few key structural features:

1. A fused cyclopentane-cyclopentene ring system
2. Common functional groups like hydroxyl, keto, and carboxyl groups
3. A lipid chain (long carbon chain)
4. Molecular weight and atom count ranges typical of prostaglandins

However, the results show that this approach missed many true positive examples of prostaglandins. The primary issue seems to be the rigid requirement for a fused cyclopentane-cyclopentene ring system. While many prostaglandins do contain this structural motif, there are also many variations and isomers that deviate from this core structure.

To improve the classification performance, we need to relax the strict structural constraints and instead focus on more general patterns and features that are common across the diverse range of prostaglandin structures.

Here are some potential improvements:

1. Instead of looking for a specific fused ring system, look for a broader pattern that captures the core cyclopentane and cyclopentene rings, either fused or joined by a single bond.

2. Incorporate additional functional group patterns beyond just hydroxyl, keto, and carboxyl groups. Prostaglandins can also contain other groups like ethers, esters, and epoxides.

3. Consider the presence of specific substructures or substituents that are characteristic of prostaglandins, such as the alpha and omega side chains, or the presence of certain stereochemical configurations.

4. Utilize more advanced molecular fingerprinting techniques or machine learning models trained on a diverse set of prostaglandin structures, rather than relying solely on hand-crafted rules.

5. Expand the molecular weight and atom count ranges based on the provided examples, as some prostaglandins may fall outside the initial ranges used in the previous program.

By incorporating these improvements, the program should be better equipped to capture the structural diversity within the prostaglandin class and improve its classification performance.
