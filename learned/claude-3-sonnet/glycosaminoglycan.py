"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18085 glycosaminoglycan
"""
The previous program attempted to classify glycosaminoglycans by looking for the presence of aminomonosaccharide residues and a polysaccharide backbone, as well as checking for certain molecular properties like molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, and number of rings.

However, the outcomes show that the program failed to correctly identify any of the provided examples as glycosaminoglycans. This suggests that the approach used in the program is not sufficient to accurately classify this class of molecules.

Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and ways to improve:

1. **Structural diversity**: Glycosaminoglycans can have diverse and complex structures, making it challenging to capture all possible variations using a simple set of SMARTS patterns. The program may need to incorporate more specific patterns or utilize other structural features to better identify these molecules.

2. **Lack of context**: The program only considers the presence of aminomonosaccharide residues and a polysaccharide backbone, but it doesn't account for the specific arrangement or context in which these moieties occur. Glycosaminoglycans may have additional structural constraints or motifs that need to be considered.

3. **Molecular properties**: While the program checks for molecular weight, rotatable bonds, and rings, these properties alone may not be discriminative enough for glycosaminoglycans. Additional properties or a different combination of properties might be required.

4. **Substructure matching limitations**: The program relies heavily on substructure matching with SMARTS patterns, which can be a powerful technique but may miss certain structural nuances or fail to capture the overall context of the molecule.

To improve the program, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Incorporate more specific patterns**: Analyze the structures of known glycosaminoglycans and identify additional patterns or motifs that are characteristic of this class. These patterns could be more specific SMARTS patterns or even larger substructures that capture the unique structural features of glycosaminoglycans.

2. **Utilize machine learning techniques**: Instead of relying solely on predefined patterns and rules, you could explore machine learning techniques that can learn from a dataset of known glycosaminoglycans and non-glycosaminoglycans. This could involve featurizing the molecules using various molecular descriptors and training a classification model.

3. **Combine multiple approaches**: You could combine different approaches, such as using SMARTS patterns to identify potential candidates, and then applying additional filters or machine learning models to further refine the classification.

4. **Leverage external resources**: Consider utilizing external resources, such as databases or literature, to identify known structural motifs, patterns, or rules for glycosaminoglycans that could be incorporated into the program.

5. **Iterative improvement**: Continuously refine and improve the program by analyzing false positives and false negatives, and adjusting the patterns, rules, or models accordingly.

It's important to note that accurately classifying complex molecular classes like glycosaminoglycans can be challenging, and may require a combination of different techniques and iterative improvement based on the specific requirements and data available.
