"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18085 glycosaminoglycan
"""
The previous program attempted to classify glycosaminoglycans by looking for the presence of aminomonosaccharide residues and a polysaccharide backbone. However, the results show that this approach was not sufficiently accurate, as there were several false positives and false negatives.

Here are some potential reasons for the poor performance and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Oversimplified Patterns**: The patterns used to detect aminomonosaccharide residues and polysaccharide backbones were too simplistic. The pattern `[NX3H2][CR]` for aminosugars only looks for a nitrogen atom with two hydrogens attached to a ring carbon, which may not capture all possible variations of aminomonosaccharides. Similarly, the pattern `[OX2]C[OX2]` for polysaccharide backbones is too broad and may match other structures that are not polysaccharides.

   **Improvement**: Use more specific and comprehensive SMARTS patterns or combine multiple patterns to better capture the structural features of glycosaminoglycans. Consult literature or databases for common substructures found in glycosaminoglycans.

2. **Lack of Contextual Information**: The program only checks for the presence of aminomonosaccharide residues and polysaccharide backbones, but it does not consider the context in which these substructures appear. Glycosaminoglycans have specific patterns in how the aminomonosaccharide residues are connected to the polysaccharide backbone and other structural features.

   **Improvement**: Incorporate additional checks for the specific arrangement and connectivity of the aminomonosaccharide residues and polysaccharide backbones, as well as other common structural features of glycosaminoglycans.

3. **Molecular Properties**: The program does not consider any molecular properties or descriptors that could help differentiate glycosaminoglycans from other compounds.

   **Improvement**: Calculate and consider relevant molecular properties or descriptors, such as molecular weight, number of specific functional groups, or structural flexibility, which may be characteristic of glycosaminoglycans.

4. **Limited Training Data**: The program was likely developed and tested on a limited set of training data, which may not have adequately captured the structural diversity of glycosaminoglycans and non-glycosaminoglycans.

   **Improvement**: Expand the training data set to include a more diverse and representative set of both positive and negative examples of glycosaminoglycans. This could involve curating data from databases or literature, or generating synthetic examples.

5. **Machine Learning Approach**: Instead of relying solely on rule-based methods, a machine learning approach could potentially learn more complex patterns and relationships from data.

   **Improvement**: Explore the use of machine learning techniques, such as random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning, to learn a classification model from a larger and more diverse set of labeled training data.

Overall, improving the classification of glycosaminoglycans will likely require a combination of more sophisticated substructure pattern matching, consideration of molecular properties and contextual information, and the use of larger and more diverse training data sets, potentially leveraging machine learning techniques.
