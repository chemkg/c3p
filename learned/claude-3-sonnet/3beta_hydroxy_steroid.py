"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36836 3beta-hydroxy steroid
"""
The previous code seems to have attempted to classify 3beta-hydroxy steroids by looking for the steroid backbone and a specific 3beta-hydroxyl group pattern. However, there are a few potential issues that could have led to the low F1 score:

1. **Overly Specific Patterns**: The patterns used to match the steroid backbone and the 3beta-hydroxyl group are very specific and may not cover the diverse range of structures within the 3beta-hydroxy steroid class. For example, the backbone pattern does not account for variations in the ring system or substituents, and the hydroxyl pattern only matches a specific connectivity pattern.

2. **Lack of Sufficient Structural Checks**: While the code checks for the number of rotatable bonds, carbon atoms, and rings, these checks may not be sufficient to accurately classify 3beta-hydroxy steroids. Additional checks for specific functional groups, substituents, or other structural features may be necessary.

3. **False Negatives**: The code may be too strict, leading to false negatives where valid 3beta-hydroxy steroid structures are incorrectly classified as negative due to the specific patterns not matching.

To improve the classification, we could consider the following approaches:

1. **Use More General Patterns**: Instead of using highly specific patterns, we could use more general patterns that capture the core structural features of 3beta-hydroxy steroids, such as the tetracyclic ring system, the presence of a 3-hydroxyl group, and the presence of specific functional groups or substituents commonly found in this class.

2. **Incorporate Additional Structural Checks**: We could add more structural checks to ensure that the molecule meets the necessary criteria for being a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, such as checking for the presence of specific functional groups, substituents, or other structural features.

3. **Use Machine Learning Techniques**: Instead of relying solely on predefined patterns and rules, we could explore the use of machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or random forests, trained on a dataset of known 3beta-hydroxy steroid structures. These techniques can learn the complex structural patterns and relationships from the data, potentially providing more accurate classification.

4. **Combine Multiple Approaches**: We could combine different approaches, such as using general patterns and structural checks as a first step, and then employing machine learning techniques on the remaining molecules to improve classification accuracy.

5. **Expand the Training Set**: If using machine learning techniques, we should ensure that the training set covers a diverse range of 3beta-hydroxy steroid structures, including variations in substituents, ring systems, and other structural features.

By addressing these potential issues and exploring different approaches, we may be able to improve the classification accuracy and achieve a higher F1 score for the 3beta-hydroxy steroid class.
