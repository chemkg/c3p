"""
Classifies: CHEBI:37143 organofluorine compound
"""
The previous program attempts to classify molecules as organofluorine compounds based on the presence of carbon-fluorine bonds or fluorinated alkyl groups. However, the program has some limitations and issues that lead to the observed low F1 score.

1. **Incomplete Pattern Recognition**: The program only checks for the presence of carbon-fluorine bonds and two specific SMARTS patterns for fluorinated alkyl groups (`[C]C(F)(F)(F)` and `[C]C(F)(F)`). However, there are many other possible patterns and structural motifs that can contain carbon-fluorine bonds, such as fluorinated aromatic rings, fluorinated heterocycles, and more complex fluorinated aliphatic groups. By limiting the search to only these specific patterns, the program may miss many organofluorine compounds.

2. **No Structural Constraints**: The program does not impose any structural constraints or filters to exclude molecules that may contain carbon-fluorine bonds but are not considered organofluorine compounds according to the definition. For example, inorganic fluorides or fluorine-containing polymers may be falsely classified as positive.

3. **No Handling of Specific Cases**: The program does not handle specific cases or exceptions, such as molecules containing fluorine but no carbon-fluorine bonds (e.g., fluorinated amines or alcohols), or molecules with fluorine atoms attached to heteroatoms instead of carbon.

4. **Limited Test Set**: The provided test set may not cover a sufficiently diverse range of organofluorine compounds and non-organofluorine compounds, leading to an inaccurate assessment of the program's performance.

To improve the program and increase its accuracy, you could consider the following strategies:

1. **Expand Pattern Recognition**: Expand the set of SMARTS patterns used to identify carbon-fluorine bonds and fluorinated groups. This could include patterns for fluorinated aromatic rings, heterocycles, and more complex aliphatic groups.

2. **Implement Structural Filters**: Introduce structural filters or constraints to exclude molecules that may contain carbon-fluorine bonds but are not considered organofluorine compounds based on the definition. For example, you could filter out inorganic compounds, polymers, or molecules with specific functional groups or substructures.

3. **Handle Specific Cases**: Implement specific rules or checks to handle cases where fluorine is present but not in the form of a carbon-fluorine bond, or where fluorine is attached to heteroatoms instead of carbon.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider incorporating additional molecular features or descriptors that can help distinguish organofluorine compounds from non-organofluorine compounds, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or other structural properties.

5. **Expand and Curate Test Set**: Expand and curate the test set to include a more diverse range of organofluorine compounds and non-organofluorine compounds, ensuring that it covers a wide variety of structural patterns and edge cases.

6. **Consider Machine Learning Approaches**: If the rule-based approach proves insufficient, you could explore machine learning techniques, such as training a classifier on a large dataset of labeled organofluorine and non-organofluorine compounds, using molecular fingerprints or other appropriate molecular descriptors as features.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating additional patterns, filters, and features, you may be able to improve the accuracy of the program in classifying organofluorine compounds based on their SMILES strings.
