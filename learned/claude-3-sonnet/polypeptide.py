"""
Classifies: CHEBI:15841 polypeptide
"""
The previous code attempted to classify a molecule as a polypeptide by checking for the presence of at least 10 amino acid residues, the connectivity of these residues in a linear or cyclic fashion, the presence of amide and peptide bonds, and compliance with Lipinski's rule of 5. However, the outcomes show that this approach failed to correctly identify any of the provided examples as polypeptides.

Here are a few potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Amino acid residue pattern:**
The SMARTS pattern used to identify amino acid residues (`'[NH2][CX4H]([CH3])([CH3])[CX4H]([NH2])[CX3](=[OH])[OH]'`) may be too restrictive. It assumes that all amino acid residues have a specific arrangement of atoms and bonds, which may not always be the case, especially for non-standard or modified amino acids. A more flexible pattern or a combination of patterns might be needed to capture a wider range of amino acid residues.

2. **Amino acid connectivity:**
The code assumes that amino acid residues are connected in a linear or cyclic fashion, but polypeptides can have more complex structures, including branched or constrained conformations. The linear and cyclic patterns used may not be sufficient to capture all possible polypeptide structures.

3. **Peptide bond pattern:**
The peptide bond pattern (`'[NH][CX3](=[OH])[NH][CX4H]([CH3])([CH3])[CX4H]([NH2])[CX3](=[OH])'`) assumes a specific arrangement of atoms and bonds, which may not hold for all peptide bonds, especially in the presence of non-standard or modified amino acids.

4. **Lipinski's rule of 5:**
While Lipinski's rule of 5 is a useful guideline for drug-like properties, it may not be a reliable indicator for classifying polypeptides. Many polypeptides, especially larger ones, may violate this rule due to their size and complexity.

To improve the classification, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Use a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns:** Instead of relying on a single pattern for amino acid residues and peptide bonds, use a combination of patterns that can capture a wider range of structural variations.

2. **Leverage machine learning techniques:** Train a machine learning model on a dataset of known polypeptide and non-polypeptide structures, using structural features (e.g., molecular fingerprints, topological descriptors) as input. This approach could potentially learn more complex patterns and relationships than hard-coded rules.

3. **Incorporate additional knowledge:** Utilize databases of known polypeptide sequences or structures to augment the classification process. For example, you could check if the input molecule matches or contains known polypeptide sequences or structural motifs.

4. **Refine the criteria:** Reevaluate the criteria used for classification and adjust them based on a deeper understanding of polypeptide structures and properties. For example, you could consider molecular weight, charge distribution, or specific functional groups instead of relying solely on Lipinski's rule of 5.

5. **Combine multiple approaches:** Use a combination of rule-based methods, machine learning techniques, and database lookups to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the classification.

It's important to note that classifying polypeptides based solely on their SMILES strings can be challenging due to the complexity and diversity of their structures. Additional information, such as sequences or experimental data, may be necessary for accurate classification in some cases.
