"""
Classifies: CHEBI:26935 tetraterpenoid
"""
The previous code attempts to classify tetraterpenoids based on the following criteria:

1. Number of carbon atoms (40-50)
2. Presence of long carbon chains (ring size > 8)
3. Presence of rings
4. At least 8 isoprene units (C5H8)
5. Molecular weight between 500-700 Da

However, based on the outcomes, it seems that these criteria are not sufficient to accurately classify tetraterpenoids. Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Number of carbon atoms**: The range of 40-50 carbon atoms may be too restrictive. Some of the false negatives, such as C1-15 thermocryptoxanthin-15 and staphyloxanthin, have a higher number of carbon atoms (61 and 51, respectively) but are still considered tetraterpenoids.

2. **Presence of long chains and rings**: While terpenoids are typically characterized by long carbon chains and rings, this criterion alone may not be sufficient to identify tetraterpenoids specifically. Some of the false negatives, such as 3,4,11′,12′-tetrahydrospheroidene and Mactraxanthin, have relatively short chains and no rings but are still considered tetraterpenoids.

3. **Isoprene units**: Checking for the presence of at least 8 isoprene units (C5H8) is a reasonable criterion, but it may be too strict. Some tetraterpenoids may have fewer isoprene units due to rearrangements or modifications of the parent tetraterpene skeleton.

4. **Molecular weight**: The molecular weight range of 500-700 Da may be too narrow. Some of the false negatives, such as C1-15 thermocryptoxanthin-15 and Salinixanthin, have higher molecular weights but are still considered tetraterpenoids.

To improve the classification, consider the following:

1. **Expand the carbon atom range**: Instead of a strict range, consider a broader range or use a different criterion, such as the presence of a specific carbon backbone or skeletal structure.

2. **Consider additional structural features**: Tetraterpenoids may have specific structural features or patterns that can be detected using substructure matching or other techniques. Analyze the structural diversity of the provided examples and look for common features or motifs.

3. **Use machine learning**: If a sufficient number of positive and negative examples are available, consider training a machine learning model to learn the structural patterns of tetraterpenoids. This approach can potentially capture more complex patterns than rule-based methods.

4. **Combine multiple criteria**: Instead of relying on a single criterion, combine multiple criteria using logical operations (e.g., AND, OR) to improve the overall classification accuracy.

5. **Refine the molecular weight range**: Analyze the molecular weight distribution of known tetraterpenoids and adjust the range accordingly or use a different criterion, such as the presence of specific functional groups or substituents.

Overall, the classification of tetraterpenoids based on SMILES strings may require a more sophisticated approach that considers a wider range of structural features and patterns. Incorporating domain knowledge and analyzing the structural diversity of the examples can help identify the most relevant criteria for accurate classification.
