"""
Classifies: CHEBI:87658 decanoate ester
"""
The previous program attempted to classify decanoate esters based on the presence of a decanoate group (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)-) attached to an oxygen atom, which is part of an alcohol or phenol group. The reasoning was correct, but the implementation had some issues, leading to the low F1 score.

Here are the potential issues and ways to improve the program:

1. **Molecular weight range**: The molecular weight range used (200-800 Da) might be too restrictive. Some decanoate esters, especially those with larger alcohol/phenol groups or multiple decanoate groups, can have a molecular weight outside this range. The range could be expanded or removed entirely.

2. **Number of oxygens**: The check for the number of oxygens (2-8) might also be too restrictive. Some decanoate esters, especially those with additional functional groups or multiple decanoate groups, can have a different number of oxygens. This check could be removed or modified.

3. **Missed cases**: The program missed some true positive cases, likely due to the restrictive checks mentioned above or due to the inability to identify more complex structures. Additional patterns or rules might be needed to capture these cases.

4. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classified some molecules as decanoate esters. This could be due to the presence of substructures that resemble decanoate esters but are not actually decanoate esters. Additional checks or rules might be needed to filter out these false positives.

5. **Edge cases**: The program might not handle edge cases well, such as molecules with multiple decanoate groups or molecules with other functional groups that could interfere with the identification of decanoate esters.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the true positive, false positive, and false negative cases to identify patterns or substructures that were missed or incorrectly classified.

2. Expand or remove the molecular weight and oxygen count checks if they are too restrictive.

3. Develop additional rules or patterns to capture complex or edge cases that were missed by the current implementation.

4. Implement additional checks or filters to reduce false positives by identifying and excluding substructures that resemble but are not decanoate esters.

5. Consider using machine learning techniques, such as fingerprint-based or graph-based methods, to learn the patterns of decanoate esters from a larger dataset of positive and negative examples.

6. Incorporate additional information or features, such as functional group counts, atom environments, or molecular descriptors, to improve the classification accuracy.

7. Test the modified program on a larger and more diverse dataset to ensure robustness and generalization.

By iteratively analyzing the results, identifying patterns, and refining the rules or methods, you can improve the accuracy and coverage of the decanoate ester classification program.
