"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36233 disaccharide
"""
The previous program attempted to identify disaccharides by looking for two monosaccharide subunits and a glycosidic bond connecting them. However, the approach has several limitations:

1. **Overly Simplified Monosaccharide Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify monosaccharides `[OX2][CX4](O)[CX3](O)[CX3](O)[CX3](O)[CX3](O)[CX2]` is too simplistic and only accounts for a linear chain of carbon atoms with oxygens attached. This pattern fails to capture the variety of monosaccharide structures, including ring formations, stereochemistry, and substituents.

2. **False Positives for Non-Disaccharides**: The program may falsely identify molecules with two monosaccharide-like subunits connected by a glycosidic bond as disaccharides, even if they are not biologically relevant disaccharides.

3. **Molecular Weight Constraint Too Broad**: The molecular weight constraint (300-600 Da) is too broad and may include or exclude valid disaccharides.

To improve the program, we need to consider the following:

1. **Incorporate Ring Detection**: Monosaccharides are typically cyclic structures, so we should incorporate ring detection into the monosaccharide pattern.

2. **Account for Stereochemistry**: Stereochemistry is crucial for the biological activity of carbohydrates. We should account for stereochemistry in the monosaccharide pattern.

3. **Handle Substituents**: Monosaccharides can have various substituents, such as phosphate groups, acetyl groups, or methyl groups. We should consider these substituents in the monosaccharide pattern.

4. **Refine Glycosidic Bond Pattern**: The current glycosidic bond pattern may be too broad and should be refined to capture the specific bond formation between the two monosaccharide units.

5. **Leverage Existing Monosaccharide Databases**: Instead of defining a SMARTS pattern from scratch, we could leverage existing databases of known monosaccharide structures and use their SMARTS patterns for substructure matching.

6. **Adjust Molecular Weight Constraints**: The molecular weight constraints should be refined based on the specific disaccharide class being targeted, as different disaccharides have different molecular weight ranges.

7. **Consider Additional Constraints**: Additional constraints, such as the number of oxygens, the presence of specific functional groups, or the presence of specific substituents, could be incorporated to improve the classification accuracy.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating more specific patterns and constraints, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of the disaccharide classification program.
