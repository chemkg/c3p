Classifies: CHEBI:36233 disaccharide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify disaccharides by identifying two monosaccharide subunits and a glycosidic bond connecting them. However, it failed to correctly identify all the provided examples as disaccharides. Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Monosaccharide SMARTS Patterns**: The SMARTS patterns used to identify monosaccharides are too general and may not cover all possible monosaccharide structures. Disaccharides can be composed of a wide variety of monosaccharides, including both common and less common ones. The program should either use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns or take a different approach to identifying monosaccharide units.

2. **Glycosidic Bond Identification**: The program checks for a glycosidic bond by looking for an O-C bond between the two identified monosaccharide units. However, this approach may not work for all disaccharide structures, especially those with more complex or unusual glycosidic linkages.

3. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used (300-600 Da) may be too narrow or restrictive for some disaccharides, especially those with larger or substituted monosaccharide units.

4. **Structural Features**: The program does not consider other structural features that are characteristic of disaccharides, such as the presence of specific functional groups or stereochemistry.

To improve the program, one potential approach could be to use a machine learning model trained on a diverse set of disaccharide and non-disaccharide structures. This would allow the model to learn the structural patterns and features that distinguish disaccharides from other molecules, without relying on hard-coded SMARTS patterns or rules.

Another approach could be to use a combination of SMARTS patterns and structural rules to identify disaccharides more reliably. This would involve developing a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns for common and less common monosaccharide units, as well as rules for identifying glycosidic linkages and other structural features specific to disaccharides.

Regardless of the approach, it is important to test the program on a diverse set of disaccharide and non-disaccharide structures to ensure its accuracy and robustness.
