"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33704 alpha-amino acid
"""
Based on the error message and the lack of true/false positives/negatives, it seems that the previous code did not successfully classify any of the provided examples. Let's analyze the code and the examples to understand why it failed and how to improve it.

Reasoning:

1. **SMILES Parsing**: The code correctly checks if the provided SMILES string is valid and returns an error if it's not.

2. **Amino and Carboxyl Group Identification**: The code uses SMARTS patterns to identify the presence of amino and carboxyl groups in the molecule. This step seems reasonable.

3. **Alpha Position Check**: The code attempts to check if the amino group is located on the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carboxyl group. However, this part of the code has a few issues:

   a. It only checks for the amino group being alpha to one of the carboxyl groups. Some examples (e.g., `Nostoc-756`) have multiple carboxyl groups, and the code might miss the correct alpha position.
   b. The code assumes that the alpha carbon has exactly three bonds (degree = 3), which may not always be the case (e.g., cyclic structures like `4-hydroxyproline`).
   c. The code does not consider stereochemistry, which is crucial for determining the alpha position.

4. **Examples**: Some of the provided examples have additional functional groups or complex structures that the current code does not account for (e.g., `Thiazostatin A`, `ovothiol A`, `N,N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine sodium salt`).

Improvements:

1. **Stereochemistry**: Incorporate stereochemistry checks to correctly identify the alpha position. The `rdkit` module provides functionality to handle stereochemistry.

2. **Multiple Functional Groups**: Account for molecules with multiple amino and/or carboxyl groups. The code should check all possible combinations of amino and carboxyl groups to determine if at least one pair satisfies the alpha position criteria.

3. **Cyclic Structures**: Handle cyclic structures by not relying solely on the degree of the alpha carbon atom.

4. **Additional Functional Groups**: Consider adding checks for other common functional groups found in alpha-amino acids, such as hydroxy groups, aromatic rings, or specific side chains.

5. **Molecular Descriptors**: Explore the use of molecular descriptors (e.g., atom hybridization, bond orders, ring information) to improve the classification accuracy.

6. **Machine Learning Approach**: As an alternative to rule-based classification, consider training a machine learning model on a diverse set of alpha-amino acid and non-alpha-amino acid examples to learn the patterns automatically.

By addressing these issues and incorporating additional checks and techniques, the classification accuracy of the program can potentially be improved.
