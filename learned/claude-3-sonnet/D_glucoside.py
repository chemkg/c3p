"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35436 D-glucoside
"""
Based on the provided code and the outcomes, it seems that the previous attempt failed to accurately classify D-glucosides. Here's what might have gone wrong and some suggestions for improvement:

1. **Insufficient Pattern Recognition**: The code attempts to find a D-glucose substructure and a glycosidic bond, but this approach may not be comprehensive enough to cover all possible D-glucoside structures. D-glucosides can have various substituents and modifications, making it challenging to capture all cases with a single pattern.

2. **Tautomer and Stereoisomer Enumeration**: While the code enumerates tautomers and stereoisomers of D-glucose, it does not consider potential tautomers and stereoisomers of the entire molecule. This could lead to missing some D-glucoside structures.

3. **Glycosidic Bond Detection**: The method used to detect glycosidic bonds involving D-glucose might be too restrictive. It looks for single bonds between an oxygen atom and a non-glucose atom, but some glycosidic bonds may have different bond types or involve more complex substructures.

To improve the performance, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Use a More Comprehensive Pattern or Fingerprint**: Instead of relying on substructure matching for D-glucose and glycosidic bonds, consider using a more comprehensive pattern or fingerprint that captures the structural features of D-glucosides more broadly. This could involve using SMARTS patterns, molecular fingerprints, or a combination of both.

2. **Incorporate Machine Learning Techniques**: If you have a sufficiently large dataset of D-glucoside and non-D-glucoside structures, you could consider training a machine learning model (e.g., a random forest or a neural network) to classify molecules based on their SMILES strings or molecular fingerprints.

3. **Consult Expert Knowledge or Literature**: Collaborating with experts in the field or consulting relevant literature may provide insights into the structural characteristics of D-glucosides that could inform the development of more robust patterns or fingerprints.

4. **Consider a Hierarchical Approach**: If classifying D-glucosides proves particularly challenging, you could consider a hierarchical approach where you first classify molecules as glucosides, and then further classify the glucosides as D-glucosides or non-D-glucosides.

5. **Expand the Test Set**: The provided test set might not be representative of the diversity of D-glucoside structures. Expanding the test set with more diverse examples could help identify limitations in the classification approach and guide further improvements.

Remember, accurately classifying chemical structures can be a complex task, and it may require iterative refinement and exploration of different techniques. Additionally, it's important to consider the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, especially for large-scale applications.
