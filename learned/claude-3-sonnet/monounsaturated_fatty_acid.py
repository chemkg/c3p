"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25413 monounsaturated fatty acid
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the previous program has the following issues:

1. **False Negatives**: The program fails to correctly classify several known monounsaturated fatty acids as positive examples. This could be due to the following reasons:

   - The program checks for the presence of a "singly bonded carbon chain" using the SMARTS pattern `"[C;H3]-[C;H2]-[C;H2]~[C;H2]~[C;H2]"`. However, this pattern may be too restrictive and might not match longer carbon chains or chains with different substitution patterns.
   - The program does not account for possible variations in the position or stereochemistry of the double/triple bond.

2. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classifies some molecules as monounsaturated fatty acids, even though they do not have a double or triple bond. This could be due to the following reasons:

   - The program only checks for the presence of a carboxylic acid group and a carbon chain, but does not explicitly check for the absence of double/triple bonds.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of deuterated compounds, which can have the same connectivity but different isotopic composition.

To improve the program, we can consider the following modifications:

1. **Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for the carbon chain**: Instead of a specific pattern, we can use a more general pattern that matches any linear carbon chain of a certain length. For example, `"[C;H3]-[C;H2]-[C;H2]~[C;H2]~[C;H2]~[C;H2]"` would match chains of at least 6 carbons.

2. **Check for the presence of exactly one double/triple bond**: Instead of checking for the absence of multiple double/triple bonds, we can explicitly check for the presence of exactly one double or triple bond using a SMARTS pattern like `"[C;H2]=[C;H2]"` or `"[C;H2]#[C;H2]"`.

3. **Consider stereochemistry and position of the double/triple bond**: We can use SMARTS patterns to match specific stereochemistry and position of the double/triple bond if required, or use a more general pattern that matches any position and stereochemistry.

4. **Exclude deuterated compounds**: We can add a check to exclude compounds with isotopic labeling, or handle them separately if required.

5. **Check for reasonable molecular weight and atom counts**: We can add additional checks for reasonable molecular weight and atom counts for fatty acids, to further improve the classification accuracy.

By incorporating these modifications, we can potentially improve the accuracy of the program in classifying monounsaturated fatty acids.
