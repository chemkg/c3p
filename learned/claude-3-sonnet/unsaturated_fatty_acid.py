"""
Classifies: CHEBI:27208 unsaturated fatty acid
"""
The previous program correctly identifies unsaturated fatty acids that contain a carboxylic acid group (-C(=O)O) and at least one C=C or C#C unsaturation. However, there are a few issues that lead to incorrect classifications:

1. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classifies some molecules as unsaturated fatty acids because it only checks for the presence of a carboxylic acid group and at least one unsaturated bond. These molecules may contain other functional groups or structural features that disqualify them from being fatty acids. Examples include esters, amides, and cyclic compounds.

2. **False negatives**: The program fails to identify some unsaturated fatty acids because it requires exactly two oxygen atoms. However, some unsaturated fatty acids may contain additional hydroxyl or hydroperoxy groups, leading to more than two oxygen atoms. Examples include 2-hydroxylinoleic acid, resolvin D6, and 20-Hydroxy-Resolvin E1.

3. **Rotatable bonds check**: The check for the number of rotatable bonds (`n_rotatable >= 4`) may not be sufficient to ensure a long fatty acid chain. Some unsaturated fatty acids may have fewer rotatable bonds due to their specific structure or the presence of cyclic elements.

To improve the program and address these issues, we can consider the following modifications:

1. **Enhance the carboxylic acid pattern**: Instead of just checking for the -C(=O)O pattern, we can use a more specific SMARTS pattern that checks for a terminal carboxylic acid group. For example, `[CH3,CH2,CH]C(=O)O` matches a carboxylic acid group at the end of a carbon chain.

2. **Handle additional functional groups**: Introduce additional checks or SMARTS patterns to exclude molecules with other functional groups that are not typically found in fatty acids, such as esters, amides, or cyclic structures.

3. **Relax the oxygen count check**: Instead of requiring exactly two oxygen atoms, we can allow for a range of oxygen atoms (e.g., 2 to 4) to accommodate unsaturated fatty acids with additional hydroxyl or hydroperoxy groups.

4. **Improve the rotatable bonds check**: Instead of a fixed threshold, we can use a more flexible approach based on the number of carbon atoms. For example, we can require a minimum number of rotatable bonds based on the carbon count (e.g., `n_rotatable >= (c_count - 2)`).

5. **Consider additional structural features**: Incorporate additional checks or SMARTS patterns to identify specific structural features commonly found in unsaturated fatty acids, such as long carbon chains with specific positions of unsaturated bonds.

By implementing these improvements, the program should become more robust and accurate in classifying unsaturated fatty acids while reducing false positives and false negatives.
