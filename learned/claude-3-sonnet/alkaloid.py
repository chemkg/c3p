"""
Classifies: CHEBI:22315 alkaloid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify a molecule as an alkaloid based on the presence of basic nitrogen, heterocyclic rings, molecular weight range, and the number of nitrogen atoms. However, the outcomes show that the program has a low F1 score of 0.07, indicating poor performance in correctly classifying alkaloids.

Here are some potential reasons for the low performance and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Molecular weight range**: The program uses a molecular weight range of 100-1000 Da to classify alkaloids. However, the examples provided show that some alkaloids have a molecular weight outside this range (e.g., beta-saxitoxinol(2+) and Gonyautoxin 2). The molecular weight range should be adjusted or removed as a criterion to account for these exceptions.

2. **Number of nitrogen atoms**: The program considers molecules with 1-5 nitrogen atoms as potential alkaloids. However, some of the false negatives (e.g., beta-saxitoxinol(2+) and Gonyautoxin 2) have a higher number of nitrogen atoms. The range for the number of nitrogen atoms should be expanded or removed as a criterion.

3. **Heterocyclic rings**: The program checks for the presence of heterocyclic rings, but some of the false negatives (e.g., sarcodine, D-synephrine, hookerianamide I, hookerianamide H) do not contain heterocyclic rings. While heterocyclic rings are common in alkaloids, this criterion may be too strict and could be relaxed or removed.

4. **Basic nitrogen**: The program checks for the presence of basic nitrogen (atoms with fewer than three hydrogen atoms). However, this criterion may not be sufficient, as some of the false positives (e.g., NBI-31772, CJ-16,367) contain basic nitrogen but are not alkaloids.

5. **Common alkaloid substructures**: The program checks for common alkaloid substructures, but this step is optional and may not be comprehensive enough to cover all types of alkaloids.

6. **Additional structural features**: The program does not consider other structural features that may be characteristic of alkaloids, such as the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., amines, amides, esters) or specific ring systems (e.g., indole, quinoline, isoquinoline).

To improve the performance of the program, consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the false positives and false negatives to identify common structural features or patterns that distinguish alkaloids from non-alkaloids.
2. Incorporate these additional structural features or patterns into the classification criteria, either by using substructure matching or by developing more complex rules or models.
3. Adjust the molecular weight range and the range for the number of nitrogen atoms based on the examples provided, or remove these criteria if they are not sufficiently discriminative.
4. Consider using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines or random forests, to learn the patterns that distinguish alkaloids from non-alkaloids based on a training dataset.
5. Evaluate the performance of the updated program on a separate test dataset and iteratively refine the classification criteria or model until satisfactory performance is achieved.
