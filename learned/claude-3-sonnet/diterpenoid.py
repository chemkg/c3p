"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23849 diterpenoid
"""
Based on the outcomes, the previous program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified several molecules as diterpenoids, even though they belong to different classes like steroids or flavonoids. This indicates that the structural constraints implemented in the program are not specific enough to differentiate diterpenoids from other classes of compounds.

2. **False Negatives**: The program missed some valid diterpenoid structures, suggesting that the constraints are too strict or that additional criteria need to be considered.

3. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used in the program (250-400 Da) may be too narrow or unsuitable for some diterpenoids. Some of the false negatives have molecular weights outside this range.

4. **Structural Diversity**: Diterpenoids can exhibit a wide range of structural diversity, including rearranged skeletons, modifications, and varying ring systems. The program's constraints may not capture this diversity effectively.

To improve the program, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Expand the Training Set**: Gather a more comprehensive set of diterpenoid and non-diterpenoid structures to better understand the structural features that distinguish diterpenoids from other classes.

2. **Refine the Structural Constraints**: Based on the expanded training set, refine the structural constraints and criteria used to identify diterpenoids. This may involve adjusting the molecular weight range, considering additional structural patterns or substructures, and incorporating more flexible rules to account for structural diversity.

3. **Incorporate Machine Learning**: Instead of relying solely on hard-coded rules, consider using machine learning techniques to learn the structural features that characterize diterpenoids from the training set. This could involve training a classifier or using techniques like one-class classification or anomaly detection.

4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine the rule-based approach with machine learning techniques using ensemble methods. This could involve using the rule-based approach as a pre-filter and then applying a machine learning model for final classification, or vice versa.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine the program by analyzing misclassifications, identifying the reasons for errors, and adjusting the structural constraints or machine learning models accordingly.

By addressing these points, the program's accuracy in classifying diterpenoids should improve. However, it's important to note that achieving high accuracy may require significant effort, especially given the structural diversity of diterpenoids and the potential overlap with other classes of compounds.
