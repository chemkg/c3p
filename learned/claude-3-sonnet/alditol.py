"""
Classifies: CHEBI:17522 alditol
"""
The previous program made a reasonable attempt to classify alditols, but it missed some key aspects of the definition, leading to incorrect classifications.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Acyclic structure check**: The program correctly checks for acyclic structures, but this condition is necessary but not sufficient to identify alditols.

2. **Hydroxyl and ether group check**: This check is too broad and allows for molecules that are not alditols. Alditols have a specific pattern of hydroxyl and ether groups, not just the presence of these groups.

3. **Alditol pattern check**: The program uses a SMARTS pattern to check for the -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- pattern, which is a good start. However, this pattern alone is not sufficient to identify alditols, as it can match other linear compounds with the same pattern but different end groups.

4. **Carbon and oxygen count check**: While this check ensures a minimum number of carbon and oxygen atoms, it does not enforce the specific ratio or arrangement of these atoms as required for alditols.

To improve the classification, we need to incorporate additional checks that more closely align with the definition of alditols:

- Check for the presence of a terminal -CH2OH group at one end of the molecule.
- Check for the presence of a -HOCH2- group at the other end of the molecule.
- Ensure that the molecule has the correct number of carbon and oxygen atoms based on the number of -CH(OH)- groups (n+2 carbons and n+2 oxygens).
- Verify that the -CH(OH)- groups are linearly arranged and not part of any ring system.

By incorporating these additional checks, the program should be able to more accurately classify alditols based on their SMILES strings.
