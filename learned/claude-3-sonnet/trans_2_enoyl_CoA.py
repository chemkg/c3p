"""
Classifies: CHEBI:50998 trans-2-enoyl-CoA
"""
The previous code has some issues that led to the low F1 score. Here are the potential problems and improvements:

1. **The coenzyme A backbone pattern is too specific**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the coenzyme A backbone is very specific and may not match all possible variations of the coenzyme A structure. A more general pattern that captures the essential features of coenzyme A would be better.

2. **The trans-2-enoyl group pattern is too specific**: Similar to the coenzyme A pattern, the SMARTS pattern used to identify the trans-2-enoyl group is quite specific and may not match all possible variations of this functional group.

3. **The fatty acid chain pattern is too lenient**: The pattern used to identify the fatty acid chain ([CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]) is too lenient and may match non-fatty acid chains or even smaller fragments.

4. **The molecular weight check is too strict**: The molecular weight check (> 1000 Da) is too strict and may exclude some valid trans-2-enoyl-CoA molecules.

5. **The atom count checks are too specific**: The checks for the exact number of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are too specific and may exclude valid structures with slightly different atom counts.

To improve the code, you could consider the following:

1. **Use a more general pattern for the coenzyme A backbone**: Look for the essential features of coenzyme A, such as the adenosine and pantothenic acid moieties, without being too specific about the connectivity or stereochemistry.

2. **Use a more general pattern for the trans-2-enoyl group**: Look for the general feature of a trans double bond at the second position of an acyl chain, without being too specific about the substituents or stereochemistry.

3. **Use a more robust pattern for the fatty acid chain**: Look for long carbon chains with a specific minimum length, allowing for branching and substitutions.

4. **Relax the molecular weight check**: Instead of a strict cutoff, use a range of molecular weights that is typical for trans-2-enoyl-CoA molecules.

5. **Remove or relax the atom count checks**: These checks may not be necessary, as the other patterns and checks should be sufficient to identify valid structures.

6. **Consider using additional checks or features**: You could explore additional features or checks that are specific to trans-2-enoyl-CoA molecules, such as the presence of certain functional groups or substructures.

By addressing these issues and improving the patterns and checks, you should be able to achieve a higher F1 score for the classification task.
