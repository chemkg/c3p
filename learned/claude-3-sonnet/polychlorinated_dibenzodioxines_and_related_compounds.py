"""
Classifies: CHEBI:134045 polychlorinated dibenzodioxines and related compounds
"""
Based on the outcomes, here are the key issues and improvements needed:

1. False Positives Problem:
- The program is too lenient in classifying molecules as "Complex polychlorinated aromatic compound with oxygen-containing linkages"
- Many molecules with chlorine/bromine and oxygen are being incorrectly classified, even when they don't fit the core structures
- We need to be more strict about the core structures and not rely just on presence of halogens and oxygen

2. Core Structure Detection:
- The SMARTS patterns for dibenzodioxin, dibenzofuran and biphenyl could be improved
- We should ensure the aromatic rings are properly fused in the core structures
- Need to verify that halogens are attached to the core structures, not just present somewhere in the molecule

3. Structural Requirements:
- Should require at least 2 halogens for polychlorinated/brominated compounds
- Need better handling of mixed halogen compounds
- Should check that halogens are directly attached to aromatic rings

4. Complex Structures:
- The "complex structures" clause is too broad and causing many false positives
- Should remove or significantly restrict this classification option

Here's how we can improve:

1. Use more specific SMARTS patterns that enforce:
- Proper ring fusion
- Correct oxygen bridge positions
- Aromatic carbon attachment points for halogens

2. Add requirements that:
- At least 2 halogens must be present
- Halogens must be attached to the core aromatic structure
- Core structure must be intact (not just fragments)

3. Remove the overly broad "complex structures" classification

4. Add better validation of halogen positions relative to core structures

5. Implement more specific checks for related compounds like formicamycins

Let me implement these improvements in the next code block.
