"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35785 sphingoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as sphingoids by looking for the following key features:

1. A sphinganine backbone pattern, using the SMARTS pattern: `[CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH1X4]([CH2X4][CH2X4][CX3](=[OX1])[NX3+,NX3][CH2X4][OX2H,OX1-])[CH1X4]([OX2H,OX1H,OX1-])[CH1X4]([OX2H,OX1H,OX1-])[CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH3X4]`
2. The presence of either a hydroxy group or an unsaturated bond, to account for hydroxy and unsaturated derivatives.
3. The presence of at least two long aliphatic chains, using the SMARTS pattern: `[CH2X4,CH3X4]~[CH2X4,CH3X4]~[CH2X4,CH3X4]~[CH2X4,CH3X4]~[CH2X4,CH3X4]`
4. The presence of at least one chiral center, to account for stereochemistry.

However, based on the provided outcomes, this approach failed to correctly classify any of the given sphingoid examples. Here are some potential reasons for the failure and possible improvements:

1. **The sphinganine backbone pattern is too specific**: The current SMARTS pattern for the sphinganine backbone is very strict, requiring the exact number of carbon atoms, the amine group, and the hydroxyl groups in specific positions. However, the definition of sphingoids includes "homologs and stereoisomers" of sphinganine, which could have varying carbon chain lengths or different positions of the functional groups. To address this, a more general SMARTS pattern for the backbone could be used, allowing for variations in chain length and functional group positions.

2. **Lack of handling for additional substituents**: Many of the provided examples contain additional substituents, such as glucose moieties or acyl chains, which are not accounted for in the current implementation. The program should be modified to allow for the presence of these additional substituents while still recognizing the core sphingoid structure.

3. **Stereochemistry handling may be too strict**: The current implementation requires the presence of at least one chiral center, but some sphingoids may not have explicitly defined stereochemistry. It might be better to check for stereochemistry only if it is present, rather than making it a strict requirement.

4. **Handling of charged species**: The SMARTS pattern for the sphinganine backbone includes the option for a charged amine group (`[NX3+,NX3]`). However, some examples have the amine group in a charged state, while others do not. The program should handle both charged and uncharged amine groups consistently.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the examples more closely to identify common structural patterns and functional groups that define sphingoids, beyond just the sphinganine backbone.
2. Develop a more general SMARTS pattern or a set of patterns that can match the core sphingoid structure while allowing for variations in chain lengths, functional group positions, and additional substituents.
3. Implement separate checks for the presence of hydroxy groups, unsaturated bonds, and long aliphatic chains, rather than combining them into a single requirement.
4. Handle stereochemistry in a more flexible manner, checking for its presence but not making it a strict requirement.
5. Ensure consistent handling of charged and uncharged amine groups.

By addressing these issues, you should be able to develop a more robust program that can accurately classify sphingoids based on their SMILES strings.
