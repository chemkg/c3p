"""
Classifies: CHEBI:53339 olefinic fatty acid
"""
The previous code appears to have a few shortcomings that led to the poor performance:

1. **Missed positives**: The code correctly identifies molecules with a carboxylic acid group and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. However, it misses some valid olefinic fatty acids because they do not have a carboxylic acid group in the form of `-C(=O)O-`. Many of the false negatives have a carboxylic acid group in a different representation, such as `-C(O)=O`.

2. **Overclassification**: The code is too broad and classifies many molecules as olefinic fatty acids even though they lack the structural characteristics of a fatty acid. For example, it wrongly classifies molecules with a carboxylic acid group and a double bond, but with a non-fatty acid backbone or additional functional groups.

3. **No checks for fatty acid backbone**: The code does not explicitly check if the molecule has a long aliphatic chain, which is a defining characteristic of fatty acids.

To improve the performance of the classifier, we can address these issues as follows:

1. **Handle various carboxylic acid representations**: Instead of looking for a specific SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid group, we can use the RDKit functionality to identify all carboxylic acid groups, regardless of their representation.

2. **Additional filters for fatty acid structure**: We can add additional checks to ensure that the molecule has a long aliphatic chain and does not have additional functional groups that would disqualify it from being a fatty acid.

3. **Prioritize specific patterns**: For molecules that pass the initial filters, we can prioritize matching against specific SMARTS patterns of known olefinic fatty acids, rather than relying solely on the presence of a carboxylic acid group and a double bond.

4. **Utilize fatty acid databases or literature**: We can incorporate information from fatty acid databases or literature to create a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns or structural rules for olefinic fatty acids.

By incorporating these improvements, we can create a more robust and accurate classifier for olefinic fatty acids.
