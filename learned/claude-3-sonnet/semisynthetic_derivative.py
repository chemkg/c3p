"""
Classifies: CHEBI:72588 semisynthetic derivative
"""
The previous attempt to classify semisynthetic derivatives has a few limitations:

1. **Reliance on a fixed set of known scaffolds**: The code checks for a predefined list of known natural product scaffolds or building blocks. However, this list may not be comprehensive, and new natural product scaffolds may be discovered in the future. Additionally, some semisynthetic derivatives may not necessarily be derived from well-known scaffolds.

2. **Arbitrary weight difference threshold**: The code uses an arbitrary weight difference threshold of 50 Daltons to determine if significant modifications have been made to the scaffold. This threshold may not be suitable for all cases, as some modifications (e.g., addition of halogen atoms) may result in a smaller weight change, while others (e.g., addition of large substituents) may result in a larger weight change.

3. **No consideration of specific modification patterns**: The code does not consider the types of modifications typically associated with semisynthetic derivatives, such as the addition of functional groups, substituents, or structural rearrangements that are characteristic of chemical synthesis.

To improve the classification of semisynthetic derivatives, we can take the following steps:

1. **Utilize machine learning models**: Instead of relying on a fixed set of scaffolds and arbitrary thresholds, we can train a machine learning model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) on a dataset of known semisynthetic derivatives and non-derivatives. The model can learn to recognize patterns and features associated with semisynthetic derivatives, including specific modifications and structural changes.

2. **Incorporate chemical fingerprints or descriptors**: Chemical fingerprints or descriptors can be used as input features for the machine learning model. These features can capture structural information, functional groups, and other relevant properties that help distinguish semisynthetic derivatives from natural products or synthetic compounds.

3. **Consider expert knowledge and literature**: Consult with experts in the field of natural product chemistry and review the literature to identify common modification patterns and structural changes associated with semisynthetic derivatives. This knowledge can be incorporated into the feature engineering process or used to refine the training dataset.

4. **Use ensemble methods or multi-task learning**: Combine multiple models or employ multi-task learning techniques to improve the classification performance. For example, one model could focus on identifying natural product scaffolds, while another model could learn to recognize synthetic modifications.

5. **Validate and refine the model**: Continuously evaluate the model's performance on new data and refine it as necessary. Incorporate feedback from domain experts and address any limitations or biases identified during the validation process.

By employing machine learning techniques, incorporating relevant chemical features, and leveraging expert knowledge, the classification of semisynthetic derivatives can be improved. However, it is important to note that the performance of the model will depend on the quality and diversity of the training data, as well as the ability to capture relevant structural and chemical information effectively.
