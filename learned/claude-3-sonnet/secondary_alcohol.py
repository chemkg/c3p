"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35681 secondary alcohol
"""
Based on the provided code and the lack of true positives, false positives, and false negatives, it seems that the previous program did not classify any molecule correctly. Here are some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Handling stereochemistry**: The current implementation does not consider stereochemistry, which can be essential for correctly identifying secondary alcohols. Some of the provided examples contain stereochemical information, such as `[C@@H]` or `[C@H]`. The program should account for these stereochemical descriptors when identifying secondary alcohol groups.

2. **Checking for saturated carbon atoms**: The program checks for carbon atoms with exactly two other carbon neighbors to identify secondary alcohols. However, it does not explicitly check if the carbon atom itself is saturated. Some of the provided examples contain unsaturated carbon atoms with double or triple bonds, which should not be classified as secondary alcohols.

3. **Ring systems**: Several examples contain ring systems, where the alcohol group is attached to a ring carbon atom. The current implementation does not handle this case specifically, and additional checks may be required to identify secondary alcohols in ring systems correctly.

4. **Handling exceptional cases**: Some of the provided examples contain additional functional groups or complex structures that may require special handling or exceptions. The program should be robust enough to handle these cases correctly.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. **Implement stereochemistry handling**: Use RDKit's functionality to correctly identify stereochemical configurations and incorporate this information into the secondary alcohol identification process.

2. **Check for saturated carbon atoms**: Ensure that the carbon atom to which the alcohol group is attached is saturated by checking the bond orders of its neighbors.

3. **Handle ring systems**: Implement a separate check for ring systems, where the alcohol group is attached to a ring carbon atom with two other ring carbon neighbors.

4. **Handle exceptional cases**: Analyze the provided examples and identify any potential exceptional cases or complex structures that require special handling. Implement additional checks or rules to handle these cases correctly.

5. **Expand the test set**: Use the provided examples and any additional examples you can find to create a comprehensive test set. This will help ensure that your program can correctly classify a wide range of secondary alcohols and non-secondary alcohols.

6. **Validate and iterate**: Test your improved program against the expanded test set, analyze any remaining errors or misclassifications, and iterate on your implementation until you achieve satisfactory performance.

By addressing these potential issues and following the suggested improvements, you should be able to develop a more robust and accurate program for classifying secondary alcohols based on their SMILES strings.
