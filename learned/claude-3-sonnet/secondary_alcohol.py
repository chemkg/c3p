"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35681 secondary alcohol
"""
The previous program attempts to classify a molecule as a secondary alcohol based on the presence of a saturated carbon atom with a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached and two other carbon atoms bonded to it. However, the provided outcomes indicate that the program failed to identify any true positives, false positives, or false negatives correctly.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Incomplete Substructure Matching**: The program relies on finding a specific substructure pattern ([OX1H]) to identify alcohol groups. However, this pattern may not be sufficient to capture all possible representations of alcohol groups in SMILES strings. Some alcohol groups may be represented differently, leading to missed matches. To address this, you could explore additional SMARTS patterns or use more comprehensive methods to identify alcohol groups.

2. **Handling Stereochemistry**: The program does not consider stereochemistry when checking the carbon atom's neighbors. In some cases, the stereochemistry of the carbon atom may be relevant in determining whether it is a secondary alcohol or not. You could consider incorporating stereochemistry checks or handling different stereoisomers separately.

3. **Edge Cases and Exceptions**: There may be edge cases or exceptions that the program does not handle correctly. For example, the program may incorrectly classify certain molecules with specific structural features or unusual representations. Analyzing the data set and identifying such edge cases could help in improving the program's accuracy.

4. **Data Set Quality**: The quality and diversity of the data set used for evaluation can significantly impact the program's performance. If the data set is too narrow or does not cover a wide range of secondary alcohol structures, the program may fail to generalize well. Expanding the data set or using a more diverse set of molecules could help identify areas for improvement.

5. **Alternate Approaches**: Instead of relying solely on substructure matching, you could explore alternate approaches such as machine learning techniques or rule-based systems that take into account additional molecular properties or features. These approaches may be more robust and better able to handle complex cases or a broader range of structures.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the false negatives and false positives (if available) to identify specific cases where the program fails and understand the reasons behind these failures.
2. Expand the set of SMARTS patterns used to identify alcohol groups, or explore alternative methods for identifying functional groups.
3. Incorporate stereochemistry checks or handle stereoisomers separately when checking the carbon atom's neighbors.
4. Identify and handle edge cases or exceptions that the program may be missing.
5. Expand and diversify the data set used for evaluation to ensure the program is tested on a wide range of structures.
6. Consider alternative approaches, such as machine learning or rule-based systems, that may be better suited for this classification task.

By addressing these potential issues and continuously refining the program based on feedback from the evaluation data, you can improve its accuracy and robustness in classifying secondary alcohols.
