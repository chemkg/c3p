"""
Classifies: CHEBI:37395 mucopolysaccharide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as mucopolysaccharides by checking for the presence of alternating uronic acid and glycosamine units, as well as the presence of sulfate groups or sulfur atoms. However, based on the outcomes provided, it appears that this approach was not entirely successful.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Incomplete Pattern Matching**: The program relies heavily on SMARTS pattern matching to identify uronic acid and glycosamine units. However, these patterns may not capture all possible variations or representations of these functional groups in SMILES strings. For example, some SMILES may represent uronic acids or glycosamines differently, leading to missed matches.

   **Improvement**: Explore additional SMARTS patterns or alternative methods to identify uronic acids and glycosamines more robustly, potentially using substructure or atom environment-based approaches.

2. **Alternating Pattern Assumption**: The program assumes that uronic acids and glycosamines must alternate in a strict pattern. While this may be true for some mucopolysaccharides, it's possible that there are exceptions or variations where the alternating pattern is not strictly followed.

   **Improvement**: Relax the strict alternating pattern requirement and consider allowing for variations or deviations from the alternating pattern, as long as both uronic acids and glycosamines are present in a reasonable proportion.

3. **Sulfate Group Requirement**: The program requires the presence of sulfate groups or sulfur atoms to classify a molecule as a mucopolysaccharide. However, some mucopolysaccharides may not be sulfated or may have alternative sulfation patterns.

   **Improvement**: Consider classifying molecules as mucopolysaccharides even if sulfate groups are not present, as long as the uronic acid and glycosamine requirements are met. Alternatively, introduce additional checks or patterns to identify different types of sulfation or sulfur-containing groups.

4. **Molecular Weight and Atom Count Thresholds**: The program uses fixed thresholds for molecular weight and atom counts to filter out potential false positives. However, these thresholds may be too strict or too lenient, depending on the specific class of mucopolysaccharides being targeted.

   **Improvement**: Refine the molecular weight and atom count thresholds based on a more comprehensive analysis of known mucopolysaccharide structures and their properties.

5. **Handling Exceptions and Edge Cases**: The program may not handle all possible variations or edge cases encountered in real-world mucopolysaccharide structures.

   **Improvement**: Continuously analyze misclassified examples and update the program to handle exceptions and edge cases as they are identified.

Overall, while the previous program made a reasonable attempt at classifying mucopolysaccharides, it could benefit from more robust pattern matching, relaxed assumptions, and fine-tuning of thresholds and requirements based on a comprehensive analysis of known mucopolysaccharide structures.
