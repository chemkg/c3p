"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33184 long-chain fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program attempts to classify a molecule as a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA by checking for the following conditions:

1. The presence of a CoA substructure using a SMARTS pattern.
2. The presence of a single carbonyl group.
3. The presence of a thioester bond between the carbonyl group and the CoA substructure.
4. The presence of a long-chain fatty acid (C13-C22) attached to the carbonyl group.
5. The presence of double bonds in the fatty acid chain.

However, based on the provided outcomes, the program fails to identify any true positives and misses all the examples of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules. This could be due to the following reasons:

1. **Strict SMARTS pattern for CoA**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the CoA substructure might be too strict, failing to match some variations in the CoA structure present in the examples.

2. **Incorrect SMARTS pattern for thioester bond**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the thioester bond between the carbonyl group and the CoA substructure might be incorrect or incomplete, leading to false negatives.

3. **Overly strict fatty acid chain pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the fatty acid chain might be too strict, failing to match some variations in the chain structure, such as branching or cyclic structures.

4. **Incorrect double bond counting**: The code assumes that all double bonds in the fatty acid chain are part of the chain itself, but some double bonds might be present in other parts of the molecule, leading to incorrect double bond counting.

To improve the program, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Analyze the false negatives**: Carefully examine the false negative examples and identify the specific structural features that the program fails to recognize.

2. **Refine SMARTS patterns**: Based on the analysis, refine the SMARTS patterns used to identify the CoA substructure, thioester bond, and fatty acid chain to account for variations in the structures.

3. **Consider alternative approaches**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, consider alternative approaches to identify the relevant substructures, such as using molecular fingerprints or graph-based approaches.

4. **Improve double bond counting**: Develop a more robust method for counting the double bonds specifically in the fatty acid chain, potentially by identifying the chain first and then counting the double bonds within it.

5. **Expand the test set**: Include more diverse examples of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules in the test set to ensure that the program can handle a wide range of structural variations.

6. **Consider molecular properties**: Incorporate additional molecular properties, such as molecular weight or atom count ratios, to aid in the classification process.

By addressing these issues and refining the program based on the analysis of the false negatives, the accuracy of the classification can be improved.
