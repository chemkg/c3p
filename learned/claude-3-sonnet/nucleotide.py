"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36976 nucleotide

The previous code attempted to classify molecules as nucleotides by checking for the presence of specific structural features, such as nucleobases, sugar moieties, phosphate groups, and glycosidic bonds. However, the approach had some limitations, which led to the poor performance observed in the provided outcomes.

Here are some potential issues with the previous code and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Nucleobase Detection**: The current approach uses predefined SMARTS patterns to detect common nucleobases like adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil. However, this approach may fail to identify less common or modified nucleobases present in some nucleotides. To improve this, you could consider using a more general SMARTS pattern or a substructure matching approach that captures a broader range of nucleobase structures.

2. **Sugar Moiety Detection**: The code relies on specific SMARTS patterns for ribose, deoxyribose, and cyclic phosphate sugars. While this approach may work for common nucleotides, it may fail to detect modified or less common sugar moieties. To improve this, you could use a more general SMARTS pattern or a substructure matching approach that captures a broader range of sugar structures.

3. **Phosphate Group Detection**: The current approach checks for the presence of a phosphate group using a specific SMARTS pattern. While this may work in many cases, it may fail to detect more complex phosphate structures, such as polyphosphates or modified phosphate groups. To improve this, you could consider using a more general SMARTS pattern or a substructure matching approach that captures a broader range of phosphate structures.

4. **Glycosidic Bond Detection**: The code checks for the presence of a glycosidic bond using a SMARTS pattern that may be too specific. It may fail to detect less common or modified glycosidic bonds. To improve this, you could use a more general SMARTS pattern or a substructure matching approach that captures a broader range of glycosidic bond structures.

5. **Handling Exceptions**: The current code does not handle exceptions or edge cases well. For example, it may not handle cases where multiple nucleobases or sugar moieties are present in the same molecule.

6. **Molecular Properties**: The current code does not consider other molecular properties that could aid in the classification of nucleotides, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or specific functional group patterns.

To improve the classification performance, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Develop a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns**: Instead of relying on specific patterns for nucleobases, sugar moieties, phosphate groups, and glycosidic bonds, develop a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns that capture a broader range of structures found in nucleotides.

2. **Use substructure matching**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, you could use substructure matching techniques to identify common structural motifs found in nucleotides. This could involve creating a library of common nucleotide substructures and checking for their presence in the input molecule.

3. **Incorporate molecular properties**: In addition to structural features, consider incorporating other molecular properties, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or specific functional group patterns, to aid in the classification process.

4. **Use machine learning techniques**: If you have a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of nucleotide structures, you could consider using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines or neural networks, to learn the patterns and features that distinguish nucleotides from other molecules.

5. **Combine multiple approaches**: Consider combining different approaches, such as SMARTS pattern matching, substructure matching, and molecular property analysis, to improve the overall classification performance.

6. **Handle exceptions and edge cases**: Ensure that your code handles exceptions and edge cases gracefully, such as molecules with multiple nucleobases or sugar moieties, or molecules with unusual or uncommon structures.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating more comprehensive and robust approaches, you may be able to improve the classification performance of your nucleotide detection program.
