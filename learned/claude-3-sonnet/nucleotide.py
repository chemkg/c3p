"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36976 nucleotide

The previous code tried to identify nucleotides based on the presence of a nucleobase, a sugar moiety, a phosphate group, and a glycosidic bond between the base and sugar. However, it appears to have some limitations:

1. The nucleobase pattern (`a1aaaanaa1`) is too general and can match non-nucleobase aromatic rings.
2. The sugar pattern (`OC1OC(O)C(O)C1O`) only matches the ribose or deoxyribose sugar, but not other sugar moieties like cyclic phosphates.
3. The glycosidic bond pattern (`[N,O]C1OC(O)C(O)C1O`) assumes a specific sugar conformation, which may not always hold true.
4. The additional checks for rotatable bonds, ring count, and heteroatom count are too broad and may not be specific enough for nucleotides.

To improve the program, we can consider the following:

1. Use a more specific pattern for nucleobases, such as the SMARTS patterns for adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil.
2. Account for different sugar moieties, including cyclic phosphates and other modifications.
3. Look for the phosphate group directly attached to the sugar moiety, rather than just searching for the presence of a phosphate group.
4. Incorporate additional checks for common structural features of nucleotides, such as the presence of specific functional groups or bond types.
5. Utilize more advanced substructure matching techniques, such as Atom Mapping or Maximum Common Substructure (MCS), to identify the nucleobase, sugar, and phosphate components more reliably.

By implementing these improvements, the program should be better equipped to accurately classify nucleotides based on their structural features.
