"""
Classifies: CHEBI:2571 aliphatic alcohol
"""
Based on the previous code and the outcomes, it seems that the program failed to correctly classify the provided examples of aliphatic alcohols. Here are some potential reasons and improvements:

1. **Insufficient Pattern Matching**: The current pattern matching for aliphatic carbon chains (`[CX4H3,CX4H2]~[CX4H2]~[CX4H2]`) is too restrictive and may not cover all possible aliphatic chain structures. For example, it may fail to match longer chains or chains with branching or unsaturation.

Improvement: Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern or consider alternative approaches to detect aliphatic carbon chains, such as checking for the presence of specific functional groups or analyzing the molecular graph.

2. **Rotatable Bond Count Threshold**: The threshold of `n_rotatable < 2` for checking the length of aliphatic chains may be too low for some aliphatic alcohols, especially those with longer chains.

Improvement: Increase the rotatable bond count threshold or consider alternative methods to determine chain length, such as counting the number of contiguous carbon atoms or using molecular descriptors.

3. **Handling Cyclic Structures**: The current program does not account for aliphatic alcohols with cyclic structures, as it assumes a linear aliphatic chain.

Improvement: Modify the pattern matching or introduce additional checks to handle cyclic aliphatic structures attached to the alcohol group.

4. **Handling Substituents**: Some of the examples provided may contain additional functional groups or substituents that are not accounted for in the current program.

Improvement: Expand the pattern matching or introduce additional checks to handle various substituents and functional groups while still recognizing the core aliphatic alcohol structure.

5. **Test Data Quality**: It's possible that the provided examples may contain errors or inconsistencies, leading to incorrect classifications.

Improvement: Carefully review the provided examples and ensure that they are correct representations of aliphatic alcohols. Consider using a more curated and reliable dataset for testing and validation.

To improve the program, you can consider incorporating more sophisticated pattern matching techniques, utilizing additional molecular descriptors or graph analysis methods, and potentially combining multiple approaches for a more robust classification. Additionally, testing the program with a diverse set of examples and performing iterative refinements based on the results can help improve its accuracy.
