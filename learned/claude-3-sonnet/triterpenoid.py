"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36615 triterpenoid
"""
The previous program had some issues in correctly identifying triterpenoids based on the outcomes provided. Here are some potential reasons for the failures and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Focusing only on the number of carbon atoms**: The program checks for exactly 30 carbon atoms, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for triterpenoids. There are examples like staphyloxanthin (51 carbons) and combretic acid A (32 carbons) that were missed due to this strict constraint.

    **Suggestion**: Relax the constraint on the exact number of carbon atoms and instead check for a range, e.g., between 28 and 35 carbon atoms.

2. **Relying too much on the triterpene skeleton pattern**: The program uses a specific SMARTS pattern to check for the triterpene skeleton, which may not capture all possible rearrangements and modifications that can occur in triterpenoids.

    **Suggestion**: Instead of relying on a single pattern, consider using a more flexible approach that checks for the presence of certain substructures or functional groups characteristic of triterpenoids, such as cyclic structures, hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, and long aliphatic chains.

3. **Not considering specific structural features**: Some examples like 3,21-dioxoolean-18-en-28-oic acid and (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16-diol were missed because the program did not consider specific structural features like the presence of an oleanane skeleton or epoxy groups.

    **Suggestion**: Incorporate checks for specific structural features or skeletons that are known to be present in triterpenoids, such as oleanane, ursane, lupane, and dammarane skeletons.

4. **Handling tautomeric forms**: Some triterpenoids may exist in different tautomeric forms, which can affect the SMILES representation and the structural patterns recognized by the program.

    **Suggestion**: Consider using tools like RDKit's MolFromSmiles function with the `isomericSmiles=True` option to handle tautomeric forms more effectively.

5. **Handling stereochemistry**: Triterpenoids often have complex stereochemistry, which may not be properly captured by the SMARTS patterns or substructure matching algorithms used in the program.

    **Suggestion**: Incorporate checks for specific stereochemical patterns or use more advanced techniques like maximum common substructure (MCS) or molecular fingerprint-based similarity methods to better handle stereochemistry.

Overall, while the previous program had a good initial approach, it may benefit from a more flexible and comprehensive set of checks that consider a broader range of structural features, tautomeric forms, and stereochemical considerations specific to triterpenoids.
