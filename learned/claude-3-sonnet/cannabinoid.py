"""
Classifies: CHEBI:67194 cannabinoid
"""
It seems the previous program attempted to classify cannabinoids based on the presence of oxygen, long aliphatic chains (15-25 carbon atoms), double bonds in the aliphatic chain, and the presence of heterocyclic rings. However, the outcomes show that the program failed to correctly classify any of the provided examples.

The root cause of the error is that the rdkit.Chem.AllChem module does not have a function called GetLongestAliphaticChain. This function does not exist in the RDKit library, which is likely why the program failed to classify any of the examples correctly.

To improve the program, we need to find an alternative way to identify the longest aliphatic chain in a molecule. One possible approach could be to use the RDKit SMARTS pattern matching functionality to identify the longest chain of aliphatic (sp3 hybridized) carbon atoms. Additionally, we may need to refine the criteria for identifying cannabinoids, as the current criteria may not be sufficient or accurate.

Here's an attempt at improving the program:
