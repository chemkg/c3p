"""
Classifies: CHEBI:4986 fatty acid methyl ester
"""
The previous code had a few issues that led to the low performance in classifying fatty acid methyl esters:

1. **Overly strict fatty acid chain length criteria**: The code required at least 5 consecutive carbon-carbon bonds to identify a fatty acid chain. However, some shorter-chain fatty acid methyl esters (e.g., methyl octanoate) were missed. The criteria should be relaxed to allow for shorter chains.

2. **Inflexible ester group pattern**: The code only looked for a specific ester group pattern (-C(=O)O-C). However, some valid structures had different atom orders or substitutions around the ester group, causing them to be missed. A more flexible pattern matching approach is needed.

3. **Strict oxygen count requirement**: The code required exactly 2 oxygens for a valid fatty acid methyl ester. However, some structures had additional oxygen atoms (e.g., in epoxy or hydroperoxy groups), leading to false negatives. The oxygen count criteria should be more flexible.

4. **No check for methyl group**: The code did not explicitly check for the presence of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the ester oxygen. This could lead to false positives for other types of esters.

5. **No check for disconnected structures**: The code did not check if the identified fatty acid chain and ester group were part of the same connected component. This could lead to false positives for disconnected structures.

To improve the classification performance, the following modifications can be made:

1. **Relax the fatty acid chain length criteria**: Instead of a fixed minimum number of consecutive carbon-carbon bonds, use a broader pattern that matches longer carbon chains with optional double bonds and substitutions.

2. **Use a more flexible ester group pattern**: Use a generalized SMARTS pattern that matches various ester group configurations, including substitutions and different atom orders.

3. **Remove strict oxygen count requirement**: Instead of checking for an exact oxygen count, focus on ensuring the presence of the ester group and fatty acid chain.

4. **Check for the presence of a methyl group**: Add a pattern match or atom neighborhood check to ensure the ester oxygen is connected to a methyl group (-CH3).

5. **Check for connectivity**: Ensure that the identified fatty acid chain and ester group are part of the same connected component in the molecule.

6. **Consider additional validation rules**: Optionally, add additional checks or heuristics based on properties like molecular weight, hydrogen deficiency, or specific substructure patterns to further improve classification accuracy.

By addressing these issues, the program should be better equipped to accurately classify a wider range of fatty acid methyl ester structures.
