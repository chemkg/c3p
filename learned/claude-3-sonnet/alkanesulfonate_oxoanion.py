"""
Classifies: CHEBI:134249 alkanesulfonate oxoanion
"""
The previous program relied solely on the presence of the SMARTS pattern "[*]-C-S(=[O])(=[O])[O-]" to identify alkanesulfonate oxoanions. While this pattern is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient to accurately classify all members of this class.

The false positives highlight some key issues with this approach:

1. The program does not distinguish between alkanesulfonate oxoanions and other sulfonate-containing molecules, such as sulfate esters, sulfonamides, or sulfonic acids.

2. It does not account for specific structural requirements, such as the position of the sulfonate group or the nature of the R group attached to the carbon adjacent to the sulfonate.

The false negatives, like methanesulfonate, are likely due to the SMARTS pattern being too strict and not allowing for variations in atom orders or connectivity.

To improve the program, we need to incorporate additional checks and constraints that better capture the definition of an alkanesulfonate oxoanion. Here are some potential enhancements:

1. **Check for the presence of a carbon atom directly attached to the sulfonate group**: This would eliminate false positives like sulfate esters, where the sulfonate is attached to an oxygen instead of a carbon.

2. **Ensure that the carbon attached to the sulfonate group has at least one hydrogen or carbon substituent**: This would exclude molecules like methanesulfonate, where the sulfonate is attached to a bare carbon atom.

3. **Look for specific structural features of the R group**: For example, you could check for the presence of a carbon chain or other common substituents to ensure that the R group meets the definition.

4. **Use additional SMARTS patterns or substructure matching**: Instead of relying on a single SMARTS pattern, you could use multiple patterns or substructure matching to capture different variations of alkanesulfonate oxoanions.

5. **Incorporate additional descriptors or properties**: You could use molecular descriptors like the number of specific atom types, charge distribution, or molecular weight to further refine the classification.

By incorporating these additional checks and constraints, you should be able to improve the accuracy of the classification program for alkanesulfonate oxoanions.
