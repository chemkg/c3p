"""
Classifies: CHEBI:87659 dodecanoate ester
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, the previous program has some issues with correctly identifying dodecanoate esters. Here's an analysis of what went wrong and potential improvements:

1. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified several molecules as dodecanoate esters, even though they did not contain the dodecanoate fragment or did not have the dodecanoate as the carboxylic acid component of an ester. This is likely due to the following reasons:
   - The program only checks for the presence of the dodecanoate fragment and an ester bond, but it does not thoroughly verify if the dodecanoate is specifically the carboxylic acid component of the ester.
   - The ester bond check (`ester_pattern`) is too broad, as it matches any ester bond in the molecule, not necessarily the one involving the dodecanoate fragment.

2. **False Negatives**: The program missed several true dodecanoate esters because it relies solely on finding the dodecanoate fragment and an ester bond. However, in some cases, the dodecanoate fragment may be present in a different SMILES representation (e.g., due to ring closures or different bond orders).

To improve the program, here are some potential solutions:

1. **Improve the verification of the dodecanoate as the carboxylic acid component**:
   - Instead of just checking for the presence of the dodecanoate fragment, analyze the bond connectivity and ensure that the dodecanoate fragment is directly connected to the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond.
   - Consider using more specific SMARTS patterns or substructure matching to ensure that the dodecanoate is the carboxylic acid component of the ester.

2. **Handle different SMILES representations**:
   - Use canonical SMILES or SMILES Augmented with Auxiliary Information (SMARTS) to account for different SMILES representations of the same molecule.
   - Consider preprocessing the SMILES string to normalize or standardize the representation before performing substructure matching.

3. **Consider additional checks or rules**:
   - Implement additional checks or rules to improve the classification accuracy, such as:
     - Checking the molecular weight or atom counts to ensure they are consistent with dodecanoate esters.
     - Verifying the presence of a long aliphatic chain or specific functional groups associated with dodecanoate esters.
     - Excluding molecules with specific substructures or functional groups that are incompatible with dodecanoate esters.

4. **Use machine learning or rule-based approaches**:
   - If the substructure matching approach proves too challenging or limited, consider using machine learning techniques (e.g., fingerprint-based or graph-based models) to classify dodecanoate esters.
   - Alternatively, explore rule-based systems or expert systems that can encode more complex rules and constraints for identifying dodecanoate esters.

5. **Improve the test suite**:
   - Expand the test suite with more diverse examples, including edge cases and challenging molecules, to better evaluate the program's performance and identify areas for improvement.

By addressing these issues and incorporating additional checks or alternative approaches, the program's accuracy in classifying dodecanoate esters can be improved.
