"""
Classifies: CHEBI:26167 polar amino acid
"""
The previous program had a few issues that led to a low F1 score:

1. **Incomplete definition of polar amino acids**: The program only checked for the presence of common polar functional groups like hydroxyl, thiol, amine, carboxyl, and imidazole. However, it missed some other cases where the side chain could form hydrogen bonds, such as guanidino groups (arginine) or amide groups (asparagine, glutamine).

2. **Overly broad polar patterns**: Some of the SMARTS patterns used to detect polar groups were too broad and matched non-amino acid structures as well. For example, the primary amine pattern "[NH2]" would match any molecule containing a primary amine group, not just amino acids.

3. **Lack of stereochemistry consideration**: The program did not account for stereochemistry, which is essential for distinguishing between L- and D-amino acids. This could lead to false positives or false negatives for stereoisomers.

To improve the program, we need to address these issues:

1. **Expand the definition of polar amino acids**: Include additional patterns or rules to cover all cases where the side chain can form hydrogen bonds, such as guanidino groups and amide groups.

2. **Refine the polar patterns**: Use more specific SMARTS patterns that are tailored to amino acid structures, rather than overly broad patterns that may match non-amino acid molecules.

3. **Consider stereochemistry**: Incorporate stereochemical information into the pattern matching or use alternative approaches to distinguish between L- and D-amino acids.

4. **Use additional filters or rules**: Besides checking for polar side chains, consider other properties or rules that can help distinguish polar amino acids from other molecules, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or specific substructure patterns.

5. **Utilize machine learning or data-driven approaches**: If the rule-based approach becomes too complex or fails to achieve satisfactory performance, consider using machine learning techniques or data-driven approaches to classify polar amino acids based on their structural features.

By addressing these issues and refining the program, we can potentially improve its accuracy and achieve a higher F1 score in classifying polar amino acids.
