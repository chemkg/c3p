"""
Classifies: CHEBI:139575 monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous code attempts to classify monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA molecules based on several criteria:

1. The presence of the CoA substructure
2. The presence of a monounsaturated fatty acyl chain (at least 6 carbon atoms, linear, aliphatic, with one double bond)
3. The number of rotatable bonds (as a proxy for chain length)
4. The number of carbon and oxygen atoms
5. The absence of ring structures

However, based on the outcomes, it appears that the code has some limitations and fails to correctly classify certain molecules.

Potential issues and improvements:

1. **Incomplete fatty acyl chain pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to detect the fatty acyl chain ([CX4,CX3]~[CX3]=[CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]) may not cover all possible cases. It assumes a minimum chain length of 6 carbon atoms and a specific arrangement of the double bond. Some of the false negatives, such as vinylacetyl-CoA and trans-4-coumaroyl-CoA, have shorter or differently arranged chains.

   **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to cover a broader range of chain lengths and double bond positions, or use multiple patterns to capture different arrangements.

2. **Strict oxygen count requirement**: The code expects exactly 6 oxygen atoms for a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. However, some false negatives, like (5Z)-3-oxotetradecenoyl-CoA and (3S,5Z)-3-hydroxytetradec-5-enoyl-CoA, have additional oxygen atoms due to functional groups like ketones or hydroxyls.

   **Improvement**: Relax the oxygen count requirement or account for additional oxygen-containing functional groups on the fatty acyl chain.

3. **Incomplete CoA substructure pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to detect the CoA substructure may not capture all possible variations. Some false negatives, like palmitoleoyl-CoA, have a slightly different CoA substructure arrangement.

   **Improvement**: Modify the CoA substructure pattern to cover a broader range of variations, or use multiple patterns to capture different arrangements.

4. **Lack of stereochemistry consideration**: The code does not consider stereochemistry, which can be important for correctly identifying certain molecules.

   **Improvement**: Incorporate stereochemistry checks into the SMARTS patterns or use alternative methods to account for stereochemistry.

5. **Potential false positives**: While the outcomes do not show any false positives, the current code may still allow some non-monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA molecules to be classified as true positives.

   **Improvement**: Introduce additional checks or filters to further refine the classification criteria and reduce the possibility of false positives.

Overall, the code can be improved by refining the SMARTS patterns, incorporating additional checks for functional groups and stereochemistry, and potentially using multiple patterns or alternative methods to capture a broader range of monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA molecules.
