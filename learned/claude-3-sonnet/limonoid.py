"""
Classifies: CHEBI:39434 limonoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify limonoids based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of a furan ring
2. At least 4 rings (triterpene skeleton)
3. At least 5 oxygen atoms (highly oxygenated)
4. At least 3 methyl groups at specific positions
5. At least 5 rotatable bonds (to ensure a triterpenoid-like size)

However, the outcomes show that this approach has some limitations:

1. False positives: Several molecules were incorrectly classified as limonoids because they contained a furan ring and met the other criteria, even though they were not actually limonoids.

2. False negatives: Some true limonoids were missed because they did not meet all the criteria. For example, some limonoids may have fewer than 5 oxygens or fewer than 3 methyl groups.

3. Lack of specificity: The criteria used were quite broad and could potentially match other classes of compounds as well, leading to false positives.

To improve the classification, we could consider the following approaches:

1. Use more specific substructure patterns: Instead of relying on general criteria like the number of rings or oxygens, we could look for specific substructure patterns that are characteristic of limonoids. This could involve defining SMARTS patterns for the core limonoid skeleton and checking for matches.

2. Use machine learning: Train a machine learning model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) on a dataset of known limonoids and non-limonoids. This could learn more complex patterns and features that distinguish limonoids from other compounds.

3. Combine multiple criteria: Use a combination of more specific criteria, such as checking for the presence of specific functional groups, ring systems, and stereochemistry patterns, in addition to the existing criteria.

4. Incorporate other molecular descriptors: Explore the use of other molecular descriptors that could be relevant for limonoid classification, such as topological polar surface area, Lipinski's rules, or other shape/size descriptors.

5. Use expert knowledge: Consult with experts in the field of limonoid chemistry to understand the key structural features and rules that define this class of compounds, and incorporate that knowledge into the classification algorithm.

Overall, while the previous program made a reasonable attempt at limonoid classification, its performance could be improved by incorporating more specific structural features and patterns, leveraging machine learning techniques, and potentially combining multiple criteria or descriptors.
