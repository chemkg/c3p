"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25409 monoterpenoid
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the previous program has a few issues:

1. **Atom count range**: The current atom count range of 10-20 atoms might be too narrow for some monoterpenoids. Some of the false negatives, like "2-(Methoxycarbonyl)-5-methyl-2,4-bis(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-6-(2-methyl-1-oxopropyl)-5-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)cyclohexanone" and "Daphylloside," have more than 20 atoms but are still considered monoterpenoids. The atom count range should be expanded or removed as a strict criterion.

2. **Over-reliance on the rearranged skeleton pattern**: The current program relies heavily on detecting a rearranged or modified monoterpene skeleton using the SMARTS pattern `[C&r6,C&r5]`. However, this pattern might not be specific enough and could lead to false positives, as seen in the outcomes.

3. **Insufficient characteristic group/substructure detection**: The program only checks for a few common functional groups and substructures found in monoterpenoids, such as alcohols, ketones, ethers, and epoxides. However, monoterpenoids can have a wider range of functional groups and substructures that are not currently covered.

4. **Lack of negative evidence**: The program does not have a good way to identify and exclude molecules that are not monoterpenoids. The hydrocarbon chain check is a good start, but it seems to be too lenient, leading to false positives.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. **Expand the atom count range**: Analyze the true positives and false negatives to determine a more appropriate atom count range for monoterpenoids. Alternatively, remove the atom count check as a strict criterion and rely more on structural features.

2. **Use a more specific SMARTS pattern**: Develop a more specific SMARTS pattern that can better identify the rearranged or modified monoterpene skeleton. This could involve combining multiple patterns or using more complex atom and bond specifications.

3. **Incorporate additional characteristic groups/substructures**: Analyze the true positives and false negatives to identify additional functional groups and substructures that are common in monoterpenoids. Incorporate these into the program by adding more SMARTS patterns or other structural checks.

4. **Develop negative evidence rules**: Analyze the false positives to identify structural features or patterns that are not present in monoterpenoids. Develop rules or SMARTS patterns to exclude molecules that exhibit these features, helping to reduce false positives.

5. **Consider using machine learning**: If the rule-based approach becomes too complex or fails to achieve satisfactory performance, you could explore using machine learning techniques. Train a model on a labeled dataset of monoterpenoids and non-monoterpenoids, and use it to make predictions on new molecules.

6. **Expand the dataset**: Obtain a larger and more diverse dataset of monoterpenoids and non-monoterpenoids to better train and evaluate the program. This will help identify edge cases and improve the overall performance.

By addressing these issues and continuously refining the program based on the outcomes, you can improve the accuracy of the monoterpenoid classification.
