"""
Classifies: CHEBI:38958 indole alkaloid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify indole alkaloids based on the following criteria:

1. Contains a fused indole substructure
2. Contains a basic nitrogen atom (alkaloid criteria)
3. Molecular weight less than 700 Da (typical for alkaloids)
4. Contains 1-3 nitrogen atoms (typical for alkaloids)
5. Contains 3-5 aromatic rings (typical for indole alkaloids)
6. Contains a bridgehead nitrogen atom (common in indole alkaloids)

However, the program failed to correctly classify several indole alkaloid examples, resulting in a low F1 score. Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Fused indole substructure pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to detect the fused indole substructure (`c1ccc2c(c1)cnc2[r]`) may be too specific or restrictive. It requires the indole ring to be fused to another aromatic ring. However, some indole alkaloids may have the indole ring fused to non-aromatic rings or have additional fused ring systems. A more general pattern or a combination of patterns may be needed to capture the diverse structures of indole alkaloids.

2. **Basic nitrogen atom requirement**: The requirement for a basic nitrogen atom (quaternary nitrogen with a positive charge) may be too strict. Some indole alkaloids may contain neutral or non-basic nitrogen atoms. It might be better to look for any nitrogen atom and consider its hybridization state and bonding environment.

3. **Molecular weight and atom counts**: The molecular weight and atom count ranges used in the program may be too narrow or specific. Indole alkaloids can have a wide range of molecular weights and atom compositions, depending on the number and size of fused ring systems and substituents.

4. **Aromatic ring count**: The aromatic ring count range used in the program (3-5) may be too restrictive. Some indole alkaloids may have fewer or more aromatic rings depending on their structural complexity.

5. **Bridgehead nitrogen atom**: The presence of a bridgehead nitrogen atom is not a strict requirement for indole alkaloids. While it is common, there may be examples that do not have this structural feature.

To improve the program, you could consider the following:

1. Analyze the structural diversity of indole alkaloids and identify common substructures or patterns that can be used for classification.
2. Use a combination of SMARTS patterns or other substructure matching techniques to capture the diverse structures of indole alkaloids.
3. Relax or remove some of the strict criteria, such as the requirement for a basic nitrogen atom or specific atom count ranges.
4. Consider using machine learning techniques or rule-based systems trained on a larger dataset of indole alkaloid structures to improve the classification accuracy.
5. Incorporate additional structural features or properties that are characteristic of indole alkaloids, such as the presence of specific functional groups, ring systems, or stereochemical configurations.

By refining the structural patterns and criteria used for classification, and potentially incorporating machine learning or rule-based approaches, the program's ability to correctly identify indole alkaloids can be improved.
