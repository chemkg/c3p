"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36315 glycerophosphoinositol
"""
The previous code attempts to classify glycerophosphoinositols, but it seems to have a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Structural Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to match the inositol group attached to the phosphate group is incorrect. The pattern `"[PX4](-[OX2]1[CH2X4][CH1X4]([CH2X4][OH1X3])[OH1X3][CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])O1)-[OX2])"` does not accurately represent the inositol ring structure.

2. **Incorrect Acyl/Alkyl Chain Count**: The code assumes that there are exactly two acyl/alkyl chains attached to the glycerol backbone, which is not always the case for glycerophosphoinositols. While some examples have two chains, others may have only one or even no chains.

3. **Molecular Weight Check**: The molecular weight check for glycerophosphoinositols being greater than 500 Da may be too strict, as some smaller examples provided in the prompt have lower molecular weights.

4. **Outcomes Analysis**: The outcomes analysis shows that there were no true positives, false positives, or false negatives, which could indicate that the provided SMILES strings were not properly processed or that the classification logic was too strict.

To improve the program, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Correct Inositol Pattern**: Revise the SMARTS pattern for the inositol group to accurately represent its structure. One possible pattern is `"[PX4](-[OX2]1[CH2X4][CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])[CH1X4]([OH1X3])O1)-[OX2])"`.

2. **Flexible Acyl/Alkyl Chain Count**: Instead of checking for exactly two acyl/alkyl chains, allow for zero, one, or two chains. This can be done by modifying the pattern and checking for the presence of matches instead of checking for a specific number of matches.

3. **Relax Molecular Weight Check**: Consider removing the molecular weight check or adjusting the threshold based on the provided examples, as some glycerophosphoinositols may have lower molecular weights.

4. **Debug SMILES Processing**: Ensure that the provided SMILES strings are being correctly parsed and processed by the RDKit functions. You may want to add additional debug statements or checks to verify this.

5. **Expand Structural Checks**: Consider adding additional checks for other structural features of glycerophosphoinositols, such as the presence of specific functional groups or bond patterns, to improve the accuracy of the classification.

By addressing these issues, the program should be better equipped to accurately classify glycerophosphoinositols based on their SMILES strings.
