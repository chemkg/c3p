"""
Classifies: CHEBI:47923 tripeptide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify tripeptides by using a SMARTS pattern to match the core tripeptide structure and additional checks on molecular weight and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. However, the approach had some limitations that led to misclassifications, as evident from the outcomes.

Here's an analysis of the issues and potential improvements:

1. **SMARTS Pattern Limitations**: The SMARTS pattern used in the previous code was too restrictive, as it only matched a linear tripeptide sequence with no substituents or modifications. However, many tripeptides can have additional functional groups, cyclizations, or other structural variations that would not match the strict pattern. To address this, a more flexible pattern or a combination of patterns may be required to capture the structural diversity of tripeptides.

2. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used (300-600 Da) may be too narrow, as some tripeptides, especially those with large or modified side chains, can fall outside this range. It might be better to use a broader range or consider other molecular descriptors in addition to molecular weight.

3. **H-bond Donor/Acceptor Counts**: While the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor count checks are reasonable, the ranges used may be too narrow or too broad, leading to false negatives or false positives. Further analysis of typical tripeptide structures and their hydrogen bonding properties may be needed to fine-tune these ranges.

4. **Structural Diversity**: Tripeptides can have a wide range of structural variations, including cyclizations, modifications (e.g., acetylation, methylation), and non-standard amino acid residues. The previous program did not account for these variations, potentially leading to misclassifications.

To improve the classification accuracy, here are some potential approaches:

1. **Employ a more flexible SMARTS pattern or a combination of patterns**: Develop SMARTS patterns that can capture a broader range of tripeptide structures, including modifications, cyclizations, and non-standard residues. Alternatively, use multiple patterns to cover different tripeptide subclasses.

2. **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors**: In addition to molecular weight, consider using other relevant molecular descriptors, such as the number of rotatable bonds, the presence of specific functional groups, or the presence of specific substructures (e.g., aromatic rings, guanidinium groups).

3. **Machine learning-based approach**: Instead of relying solely on rule-based methods, consider training a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, support vector machine) on a dataset of known tripeptides and non-tripeptides. This approach can potentially capture more complex patterns and structural variations.

4. **Incorporate external data sources**: Leverage existing databases or knowledge sources that provide information on tripeptide structures and their properties. This can help refine the classification rules or provide training data for machine learning models.

5. **Hierarchical classification**: Consider a hierarchical approach where you first classify the molecule as a peptide or oligopeptide, and then further classify it as a tripeptide based on more specific criteria.

6. **Iterative refinement**: Continuously refine the classification rules or models based on misclassified examples and feedback from domain experts or literature.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating more robust patterns, additional molecular descriptors, and potentially machine learning techniques, the classification accuracy for tripeptides can be improved.
