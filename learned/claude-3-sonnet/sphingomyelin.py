"""
Classifies: CHEBI:64583 sphingomyelin
"""
The previous program attempted to classify sphingomyelins by checking for the presence of a sphingoid base, a fatty acid chain attached via an amide linkage, and a phosphorylcholine group ester-linked to the terminal hydroxy group of the sphingoid base. However, it failed to correctly identify the provided examples of sphingomyelins.

Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and ways to improve it:

1. **Rigid Substructure Matching**: The program relied on rigid SMARTS patterns to identify the key structural components of a sphingomyelin. However, sphingomyelins can have diverse structures, with varying chain lengths, double bond positions, and substituents. A more flexible approach is needed to account for this structural diversity.

2. **Stereochemistry Handling**: The previous program did not consider stereochemistry, which is crucial for correctly identifying sphingomyelins. The sphingoid base and the fatty acid chain can have specific stereochemistries that need to be accounted for.

3. **Incomplete Structural Constraints**: The program checked for the presence of key components but did not ensure that they were correctly connected or positioned within the molecule. For example, it did not verify that the phosphorylcholine group was indeed ester-linked to the terminal hydroxy group of the sphingoid base.

4. **Molecular Weight and Atom Count Constraints**: While the program checked for molecular weight and atom count constraints, these may not be sufficient or robust enough to accurately classify sphingomyelins.

To improve the program, we can consider the following approaches:

1. **Use More Flexible SMARTS Patterns**: Instead of rigid patterns, we can use more flexible SMARTS patterns that allow for variations in chain lengths, double bond positions, and substituents.

2. **Incorporate Stereochemistry Checks**: We can include SMARTS patterns or other checks to ensure that the stereochemistry of the sphingoid base and the fatty acid chain matches the expected configurations.

3. **Ensure Correct Connectivity and Positioning**: We can use SMARTS patterns or other techniques to verify that the key components (sphingoid base, fatty acid chain, and phosphorylcholine group) are correctly connected and positioned within the molecule.

4. **Consider Additional Structural Features**: We may need to incorporate additional structural features or constraints specific to sphingomyelins, such as the presence of a trans double bond in the sphingoid base or the presence of a specific substituent pattern.

5. **Use Machine Learning Techniques**: If the rule-based approach proves too complex or fails to capture the structural diversity of sphingomyelins, we could explore the use of machine learning techniques, such as training a classifier on a large dataset of known sphingomyelins and non-sphingomyelins.

By addressing these issues and incorporating more robust structural constraints and checks, we can potentially improve the accuracy of the sphingomyelin classification program.
