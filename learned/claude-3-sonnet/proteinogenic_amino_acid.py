"""
Classifies: CHEBI:83813 proteinogenic amino acid
"""
Here's my analysis of the previous program and the outcomes:

The previous program attempted to classify proteinogenic amino acids by checking if the molecule is an alpha-amino acid, and then checking if the side chain matches one of the proteinogenic amino acid side chains. However, there were a few issues:

1. **Import Error**: The program tried to import `AllChem` from `rdkit.Chem.rdChemReactions`, which is incorrect. `AllChem` is a part of the `rdkit.Chem` module, not `rdkit.Chem.rdChemReactions`. This caused an import error and the program failed to run.

2. **Side Chain Identification**: The program used `AllChem.GetMolFragsWithSPorts` to identify the side chain of the amino acid. However, this function is designed to find specific reaction sites in a molecule, not to identify side chains. This likely caused the side chain identification to fail in many cases.

3. **Side Chain Matching**: The program attempted to match the side chain SMARTS pattern against a dictionary of proteinogenic amino acid side chain patterns (`AllChem.SmartsPatts.proteinogenic_amino_acids`). However, this dictionary does not seem to be a part of the RDKit library, which suggests that it is either a custom dictionary or a typo.

4. **Stereochemistry**: The program did not check for the stereochemistry of the amino acid, which is a crucial aspect of proteinogenic amino acids (except for glycine). Most proteinogenic amino acids have the L-configuration, and this should be checked.

To improve the program, we need to fix the import issue, find a more reliable way to identify and extract the side chain, and implement checks for the stereochemistry and specific side chain patterns of proteinogenic amino acids. We can also consider using pre-defined molecular patterns or SMARTS patterns for proteinogenic amino acids, rather than trying to build them dynamically.
