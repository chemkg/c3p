Classifies: CHEBI:26208 polyunsaturated fatty acid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify polyunsaturated fatty acids by checking for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, multiple double bonds, and a long carbon chain. However, the outcomes show several issues with this approach:

1. **False Positives**: Many molecules containing carboxylic acids, double bonds, and long carbon chains were incorrectly classified as polyunsaturated fatty acids. These include lipids like phospholipids, diglycerides, and triglycerides, which do not fall under the definition of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

2. **False Negatives**: Several polyunsaturated fatty acids with shorter carbon chains were missed by the program because it required a minimum of three consecutive CH2/CH3 groups to identify a "long carbon chain."

3. **Lack of Specificity**: The program does not account for the specific structural features that define polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as the location and geometry of the double bonds, the length of the carbon chain, and the presence of other functional groups.

To improve the classification, we need to incorporate more specific rules and patterns that capture the essential characteristics of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Check for a single carboxylic acid group**: Polyunsaturated fatty acids should have exactly one carboxylic acid group at one end of the molecule.

2. **Check for double bond geometry and position**: Polyunsaturated fatty acids typically have cis double bonds spaced at specific intervals along the carbon chain (e.g., Δ9, Δ12, Δ15, etc.).

3. **Check for carbon chain length**: Polyunsaturated fatty acids typically have carbon chain lengths between 16 and 24 carbons.

4. **Exclude other lipid classes**: Explicitly check for the absence of other functional groups or structural features that would classify the molecule as a different lipid class (e.g., phosphate groups for phospholipids, glycerol backbone for triglycerides, etc.).

5. **Use a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns**: Develop SMARTS patterns that capture the specific structural features of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including double bond geometry, carbon chain length, and the presence/absence of certain functional groups.

6. **Consider using machine learning models**: For more complex classifications, machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset of polyunsaturated fatty acids and other lipid classes may provide better accuracy and generalization.

By incorporating these improvements, the program should be able to more accurately classify polyunsaturated fatty acids while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
