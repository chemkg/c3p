"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23053 catechin
"""
The previous program attempted to classify catechins by looking for the presence of a flavan-3-ol core and allowing certain substituents. However, the approach has several limitations that led to the poor performance:

1. **Incomplete flavan-3-ol core pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to find the flavan-3-ol core is too specific and does not account for all possible variations. Many catechin structures in the examples do not match this pattern.

2. **Overly restrictive substituent rules**: The allowed substituent SMARTS pattern is too narrow, excluding many common catechin substituents like gallate, sulfate, and long alkyl chains.

3. **Banned substructure filtering is too aggressive**: The list of banned SMARTS patterns excludes many valid catechin structures containing carbonyl groups, sulfur, and other common substituents.

4. **No consideration of structural features**: The program does not check for key structural features of catechins, such as the presence of a benzopyran core, the number of rings, or the positions of substituents.

To improve the program, we need to take a more comprehensive approach that considers the diverse structural variations of catechins. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Use a more flexible flavan-3-ol core pattern**: The pattern should allow for different substitution patterns and ring conformations.

2. **Allow a broader range of substituents**: Catechins can have a wide variety of substituents, including gallate, sulfate, long alkyl chains, and more.

3. **Remove or relax the banned substructure filtering**: Many catechins contain carbonyl groups, sulfur, and other functional groups that were previously banned.

4. **Incorporate structural feature checks**: Look for the presence of a benzopyran core, the correct number of rings, and substituent positions that are consistent with catechins.

5. **Consider using machine learning approaches**: Given the structural complexity and diversity of catechins, a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of catechin structures could potentially perform better than a hand-crafted rule-based approach.

Addressing these limitations should improve the program's ability to accurately classify catechin structures. However, it's important to note that catechins are a diverse class of compounds, and achieving high accuracy may require a combination of different approaches and techniques.
