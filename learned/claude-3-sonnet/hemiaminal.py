"""
Classifies: CHEBI:73080 hemiaminal
"""
Based on the outcomes, it appears that the previous program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **False positives**: The program is incorrectly classifying some molecules as hemiaminals when they do not meet the criteria. This could be due to the SMARTS pattern being too broad or not specific enough to exclude other similar substructures.

2. **False negatives**: The program is missing some true hemiaminal structures, failing to identify them correctly. This could be because the SMARTS pattern is too strict or not capturing all possible variations of the hemiaminal substructure.

3. **Stereochemistry**: The program does not account for stereochemistry, which can be important in determining whether a given structure is a hemiaminal or not. Some of the false positives and false negatives could be related to this issue.

To improve the program, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Refine the SMARTS pattern**: Analyze the false positives and false negatives to identify patterns or substructures that are being incorrectly handled. Modify the SMARTS pattern to be more specific and exclude undesired substructures while including all valid hemiaminal variations.

2. **Consider stereochemistry**: Incorporate stereochemical information into the SMARTS pattern or add additional checks to ensure that the program correctly identifies hemiaminals based on their stereochemistry.

3. **Additional checks**: Implement additional checks beyond the SMARTS pattern match, such as verifying the connectivity of the atoms, checking for other functional groups or substituents that may disqualify a structure from being a hemiaminal, or ensuring that the amino group and hydroxy group are attached to the same carbon atom.

4. **Test extensively**: Build a comprehensive set of test cases, including true positives, true negatives, and edge cases, to thoroughly evaluate the program's performance and identify any remaining issues or edge cases that need to be addressed.

By addressing these issues, the program should be able to more accurately classify hemiaminal structures and reduce the number of false positives and false negatives.
