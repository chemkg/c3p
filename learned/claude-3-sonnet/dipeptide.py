Classifies: CHEBI:46761 dipeptide
"""
The previous program attempted to identify dipeptides by looking for the presence of a single peptide bond (-C(=O)-N-C-C(=O)-) and two amino acid residues (N-C-C). However, the approach has some limitations, as evidenced by the outcomes where it failed to correctly identify several known dipeptides.

Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Peptide bond pattern too specific**: The SMARTS pattern `C(=O)NC(=O)` used to identify peptide bonds is too specific and may miss some valid peptide bond patterns. For example, it would not match a peptide bond where the nitrogen is protonated or has other substituents.

2. **Amino acid pattern too specific**: The SMARTS pattern `[N;X3;H2,H1]([C;X4])[C;X4]` used to identify amino acid residues is also quite specific and may miss some valid residues. For instance, it would not match residues with non-standard substitutions or those with different valence states.

3. **Ignoring stereochemistry**: The current approach does not consider stereochemistry, which is crucial for identifying specific dipeptides correctly.

4. **Failure to account for protecting groups**: Many synthetic dipeptides may have protecting groups or other modifications that could prevent the patterns from being recognized correctly.

5. **Reliance on substructure matching**: While substructure matching is a powerful tool, it may not be sufficient for accurately identifying complex molecular structures like dipeptides, especially in the presence of uncommon or non-standard features.

To improve the program, we could consider the following approaches:

1. **Use a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns**: Instead of relying on a single pattern for peptide bonds and amino acid residues, we could use a set of patterns that cover a broader range of possibilities, including different protonation states, substitutions, and protecting groups.

2. **Incorporate stereochemistry**: We could use RDKit's functionality to detect and match specific stereochemical configurations, which are essential for correctly identifying specific dipeptides.

3. **Utilize machine learning models**: Instead of relying solely on substructure matching, we could explore the use of machine learning models trained on a large dataset of dipeptides and non-dipeptides. These models could potentially learn to recognize more complex patterns and features that are not easily captured by SMARTS patterns.

4. **Combine multiple approaches**: We could combine different approaches, such as substructure matching, stereochemistry checking, and machine learning models, to create a more robust and accurate dipeptide classification system.

5. **Leverage external data sources**: We could utilize external data sources, such as databases of known dipeptides or literature references, to improve the training and validation of our classification system.

6. **Handle exceptional cases**: We could explicitly handle exceptional cases, such as cyclic peptides, peptides with non-standard amino acids, or those with unusual modifications, by incorporating additional rules or patterns.

Ultimately, accurately classifying complex chemical entities like dipeptides may require a more sophisticated approach that combines multiple techniques and leverages additional data sources and domain knowledge.
