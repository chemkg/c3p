"""
Classifies: CHEBI:16701 nucleoside 5'-phosphate
"""
The previous code attempted to classify nucleoside 5'-phosphates by checking for the following structural features:

1. Ribose or deoxyribose backbone
2. Pyrimidine or purine base
3. Phosphate group(s) attached to the C-5 position of the ribose/deoxyribose ring

However, the code failed to correctly identify any true positive or false positive/negative examples, suggesting issues with the implemented logic.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Ribose/deoxyribose backbone detection**: The SMARTS pattern used for detecting the ribose/deoxyribose backbone (`"[OX2]C1[CH]([OX2])[CH]([OX2])[CH]([OX2])[CH]1"`) may not be accurate or comprehensive enough. It might be missing some valid variations or including invalid ones.

   - Suggestion: Analyze the false negatives and true positives to identify patterns that were missed. Consider using a more flexible or relaxed SMARTS pattern or combine multiple patterns.

2. **Pyrimidine/purine base detection**: The SMARTS patterns used for detecting the bases are limited to a specific set of tautomers and may not cover all possible representations.

   - Suggestion: Explore using more general SMARTS patterns or investigate alternative methods for base detection, such as substructure matching against a set of known base fragments.

3. **Phosphate group detection and attachment**: The code checks for the presence of a phosphate group and its attachment to the C-5 position of the ribose/deoxyribose ring. However, it does not consider the possibility of multiple phosphate groups (di-, tri-, or tetra-phosphorylated) or handle branched phosphate groups correctly.

   - Suggestion: Modify the phosphate group detection logic to handle multiple phosphate groups and branched structures. Consider using recursive SMARTS patterns or substructure matching against a set of known phosphate group patterns.

4. **False positives and negatives**: Without any identified true positives or false positives/negatives, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact issues in the logic.

   - Suggestion: Analyze the provided examples and identify potential true positives and false positives/negatives. Use this information to refine the logic and patterns used in the code.

5. **Additional checks**: The current code does not perform any additional checks or validations beyond the basic structural features.

   - Suggestion: Consider adding additional checks or filters based on the provided definition, such as molecular weight, atom count, or other relevant molecular descriptors.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating the suggested improvements, the code's ability to correctly classify nucleoside 5'-phosphates should improve. Additionally, it is essential to iteratively test and refine the code using a diverse set of examples to ensure robustness and accuracy.
