"""
Classifies: CHEBI:16701 nucleoside 5'-phosphate
"""
The previous code attempts to classify molecules as nucleoside 5'-phosphates based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of a ribose or deoxyribose backbone
2. Presence of a pyrimidine or purine base
3. Presence of a phosphate group attached to the C-5 position of the ribose/deoxyribose ring
4. Number of phosphate groups between 1 and 4
5. Molecular weight between 300 and 1000 Da

However, based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the code is missing some important structural features and failing to correctly identify many nucleoside 5'-phosphates.

The following issues can be identified:

1. The ribose/deoxyribose backbone patterns used are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible variations in the ring conformations and substitutions.
2. The pyrimidine/purine base patterns are too specific and may not cover all possible bases present in nucleoside 5'-phosphates.
3. The code does not account for modifications or substitutions on the base or ribose/deoxyribose rings, which are common in many nucleoside 5'-phosphates.
4. The code does not consider the stereochemistry of the ribose/deoxyribose ring and the phosphate groups, which is crucial for correctly identifying these molecules.
5. The molecular weight range may be too narrow, as some nucleoside 5'-phosphates with larger substituents or multiple phosphate groups can fall outside this range.

To improve the performance of the program, the following modifications can be considered:

1. Use a more general SMARTS pattern to match the ribose/deoxyribose backbone, accounting for different ring conformations and substitutions.
2. Expand the set of SMARTS patterns for pyrimidine/purine bases to cover a wider range of possible bases.
3. Incorporate SMARTS patterns to identify common modifications and substitutions on the base and ribose/deoxyribose rings.
4. Implement checks for the stereochemistry of the ribose/deoxyribose ring and the phosphate groups.
5. Adjust the molecular weight range based on the range observed in the provided examples.
6. Consider additional structural features or properties that can help differentiate nucleoside 5'-phosphates from other molecules.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to use machine learning techniques or rule-based expert systems to improve the classification accuracy, especially for complex molecules with multiple structural features.
