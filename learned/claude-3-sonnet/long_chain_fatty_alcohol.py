"""
Classifies: CHEBI:17135 long-chain fatty alcohol
"""
The previous program attempted to classify long-chain fatty alcohols using the following criteria:

1. Presence of an -OH (alcohol) group
2. Presence of a long carbon chain (C13-C22)
3. Linear, non-cyclic structure
4. Connectivity between the alcohol group and the carbon chain
5. Molecular weight range (200-350 Da)

However, the program failed to correctly classify any of the provided examples. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Strict SMARTS pattern for carbon chain**: The SMARTS pattern used to detect the long carbon chain ([CX4]([CX4])[CX4]([CX4])...) may be too strict. It assumes a specific branching pattern and may not match chains with different branching or substitution patterns.

2. **No consideration for double bonds**: The program does not account for the presence of double bonds in the carbon chain, which are common in fatty alcohols.

3. **Molecular weight range may be too narrow**: The molecular weight range of 200-350 Da may be too narrow, as some of the examples fall outside this range.

4. **Connectivity check may be too strict**: The connectivity check between the alcohol group and the carbon chain may be too strict, as it only checks for direct connectivity. Some examples may have short linkers or functional groups between the alcohol and the chain.

To improve the program, we can consider the following modifications:

1. **Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for carbon chain**: Instead of a strict pattern, we can use a more flexible pattern that matches a broad range of carbon chain lengths and branching patterns.

2. **Account for double bonds**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns to detect double bonds in the carbon chain.

3. **Adjust molecular weight range**: Analyze the provided examples and adjust the molecular weight range accordingly.

4. **Relax connectivity check**: Instead of checking for direct connectivity, allow for short linkers or functional groups between the alcohol and the carbon chain.

5. **Consider additional structural features**: Analyze the provided examples and identify any additional structural features or patterns that could help in classification.

6. **Use machine learning or fingerprint-based methods**: If the rule-based approach becomes too complex, consider using machine learning or fingerprint-based methods for classification.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating the necessary modifications, the program's performance in classifying long-chain fatty alcohols should improve.
