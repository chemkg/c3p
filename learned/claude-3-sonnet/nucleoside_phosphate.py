"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25608 nucleoside phosphate
"""
Let's analyze the previous program and the outcomes:

The program attempted to identify nucleoside phosphates by looking for specific structural patterns:

1. A nucleobase (fused or heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms)
2. A sugar ring (5-membered ring with one oxygen and four carbon atoms)
3. One or more phosphate groups (-O-P(=O)(O)-O-)
4. A glycosidic bond between the nucleobase and the sugar ring

However, the outcomes show that the program failed to identify any true positives, false positives, or false negatives, which means it did not classify any molecules correctly or incorrectly.

There could be a few reasons for this failure:

1. **Overly restrictive patterns**: The patterns used to identify the nucleobase, sugar ring, and glycosidic bond might be too specific and not cover all possible variations of nucleoside phosphates.

2. **Incorrect pattern representation**: The SMARTS patterns used to represent the structural features might be incorrect or incomplete, leading to missed matches.

3. **Lack of additional checks**: The program might need additional checks or constraints to ensure that the identified substructures are correctly combined and match the definition of a nucleoside phosphate.

To improve the program, you could consider the following strategies:

1. **Analyze examples**: Carefully examine the provided examples of nucleoside phosphates and identify any patterns or structural features that the current program might be missing.

2. **Relax or expand patterns**: If the patterns are too restrictive, try relaxing them or using more general patterns to cover a broader range of structures.

3. **Check for missing features**: Ensure that the program checks for all the necessary features defined in the nucleoside phosphate class, such as the presence of a nucleobase, sugar ring, phosphate group(s), and their correct connectivity.

4. **Add additional constraints**: Implement additional checks or constraints to ensure that the identified substructures are correctly combined and satisfy the definition of a nucleoside phosphate.

5. **Use existing libraries or resources**: Consider using existing libraries or resources specifically designed for identifying or working with nucleoside phosphates, as they might have more robust and comprehensive pattern matching capabilities.

6. **Test and refine**: Continuously test the program with a diverse set of examples, both positive and negative, and refine the patterns and checks based on the results.

By iteratively improving the program and addressing the potential issues identified in the analysis, you should be able to achieve better performance in classifying nucleoside phosphates.
