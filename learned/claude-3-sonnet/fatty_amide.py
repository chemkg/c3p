"""
Classifies: CHEBI:29348 fatty amide

In the previous attempt, there were a few issues that led to a low F1 score:

1. **Error handling**: The code raises an exception when the `MolFromSmiles` function fails to parse the SMILES string, which is not ideal. Instead, it should return `False` and an appropriate error message.

2. **Pattern matching**: The pattern used to match the amide group (`C(=O)N`) is too broad and can match other functional groups containing a carbonyl and a nitrogen atom, such as imines or nitriles. A more specific pattern for amides should be used.

3. **Carbon chain matching**: The pattern used to match the carbon chain (`[CX4]~[CX4]`) is too broad and can match any two connected carbon atoms, including those in ring systems or with other functional groups. A more specific pattern for linear carbon chains should be used.

4. **Ring system check**: The code checks if the amide group is part of a ring system, but this check may be too strict. Some fatty amides may contain ring systems as part of their structure, as long as the amide group is not part of the ring.

5. **Functional group check**: The code checks for the presence of common functional groups found in lipids and carbohydrates, but this check may be too broad and exclude some valid fatty amides that contain these functional groups.

6. **Rotatable bond count**: The rotatable bond count threshold of 2 may be too low for some fatty amides, especially those with longer carbon chains.

7. **Molecular weight check**: The molecular weight threshold of 100 Da may be too low for some fatty amides, especially those with longer carbon chains or additional substituents.

To improve the program, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Error handling**: Use a try-except block to catch the `MolFromSmiles` error and return `False` and an appropriate error message.

2. **Pattern matching**: Use a more specific pattern for amide groups, such as `C(=O)N[!#1]`, which matches a carbonyl carbon connected to a nitrogen atom that is not connected to a hydrogen atom.

3. **Carbon chain matching**: Use a pattern that matches linear carbon chains of a certain length, such as `[CX4][CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]` for chains of at least 5 carbon atoms.

4. **Ring system check**: Instead of checking if the amide group is part of a ring system, check if the carbon chain is part of a ring system, as some fatty amides may contain ring systems in their structure.

5. **Functional group check**: Remove or modify the check for common functional groups found in lipids and carbohydrates, as some valid fatty amides may contain these groups.

6. **Rotatable bond count**: Increase the rotatable bond count threshold to a higher value, such as 5 or more, to account for longer carbon chains.

7. **Molecular weight check**: Increase the molecular weight threshold to a higher value, such as 200 Da or more, to account for longer carbon chains and additional substituents.

By implementing these improvements, the program should be able to classify fatty amides more accurately and achieve a higher F1 score.
