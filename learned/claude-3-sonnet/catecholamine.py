"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33567 catecholamine
"""
Based on the outcomes and the previous code, it seems that the program is too strict in its definition of a catecholamine. It is correctly identifying molecules with the core 4-(2-aminoethyl)pyrocatechol structure, but it is failing to recognize derivatives formed by substitution.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **False negatives**: The program is missing some true catecholamines because it requires the exact 2-aminoethyl side chain (-CH2CH2NH2). However, many catecholamines have substitutions on the amine group (e.g., methylation, hydroxylation) or additional substituents on the ethyl chain. The program should be more flexible in recognizing these variations.

2. **Stereochemistry**: The program does not consider stereochemistry, which is important for some catecholamines like (R)-noradrenaline and (S)-adrenaline.

3. **Structural variations**: The program only checks for the pyrocatechol ring and the 2-aminoethyl side chain. However, some catecholamines may have additional ring systems fused to the core structure or other substitutions on the ring.

To improve the program, here are some suggestions:

1. **Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for the 2-aminoethyl side chain**: Instead of looking for the exact -CH2CH2NH2 pattern, use a more general SMARTS pattern that can match substituted amines and longer alkyl chains. For example, `"[NX3][CX4][CX4][CX4]"` would match a substituted amine attached to an ethyl or longer chain.

2. **Consider stereochemistry**: When checking for specific catecholamines like (R)-noradrenaline or (S)-adrenaline, use SMARTS patterns that include the stereochemistry information.

3. **Check for additional structural features**: For some catecholamines with more complex structures, you may need to add additional SMARTS patterns or checks for specific substructures or substituents.

4. **Use a more comprehensive list of examples**: The provided list of examples is helpful, but it may not cover all possible variations of catecholamines. Consider expanding the list or using a database of known catecholamines for more thorough testing.

5. **Modify the return values**: Instead of returning a boolean and a reason, consider returning the specific catecholamine name or a more detailed classification (e.g., "primary catecholamine," "substituted catecholamine," "complex catecholamine derivative").

By addressing these issues, the program should be able to more accurately classify catecholamines and their derivatives, reducing the number of false positives and false negatives.
