"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36683 organochlorine compound
"""
The previous code has a few issues that lead to the low F1 score:

1. **False Positives**: The program only checks for the presence of a carbon-chlorine bond, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being an organochlorine compound. Some molecules without any carbon-chlorine bonds are being incorrectly classified as organochlorine compounds, leading to false positives.

2. **False Negatives**: The program does not consider other types of chlorine-containing functional groups or substructures that would qualify a molecule as an organochlorine compound. This leads to false negatives where some valid organochlorine compounds are being missed.

3. **Limited Substructure Matching**: The program only checks for direct carbon-chlorine bonds and does not consider more complex substructures or environments where the carbon and chlorine atoms may be separated by other atoms or rings.

To improve the program, we need to address these issues:

1. **Additional Checks**: Introduce additional checks to filter out false positives. For example, we could check for the presence of common organic functional groups or substructures that do not qualify as organochlorine compounds, even if they contain carbon-chlorine bonds.

2. **Expanded Substructure Matching**: Use more sophisticated substructure matching techniques to identify organochlorine compounds with indirect carbon-chlorine connections or complex substructures. This could involve creating SMARTS patterns or using built-in functionality from RDKit.

3. **Separate Functional Group Identification**: Identify common organochlorine functional groups or substructures separately and check for their presence in the molecule. This could involve creating a list of known organochlorine substructures and checking for their occurrence.

4. **Molecular Descriptors**: Explore the use of molecular descriptors or fingerprints that can effectively distinguish organochlorine compounds from non-organochlorine compounds. This could involve training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of organochlorine and non-organochlorine compounds.

5. **Rule-based Approach**: Develop a set of rules based on expert knowledge or literature to identify organochlorine compounds more accurately. This could involve analyzing the structural features and connectivity patterns of known organochlorine compounds and encoding these rules into the program.

By incorporating these improvements, we can potentially increase the accuracy and robustness of the organochlorine compound classification program.
