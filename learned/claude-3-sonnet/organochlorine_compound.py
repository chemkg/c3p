"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36683 organochlorine compound
"""
The previous program had a reasonable approach to classifying organochlorine compounds based on the presence of carbon-chlorine bonds and common organochlorine functional groups. However, the outcomes show that it still had some issues with false positives and false negatives.

False positives:
The program classified several molecules as organochlorine compounds even though they did not contain typical organochlorine functional groups or structural features. For example:

- N-[2-chloro-5-(4-morpholinylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-2-(2-phenyl-3-indolizinyl)acetamide
- 3-(2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl)-N-(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl)-5-methyl-4-isoxazolecarboxamide
- LSM-14602
- (2S)-2-[5-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methylthio]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]-1-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid tert-butyl ester
- ... and several others

These molecules contain carbon-chlorine bonds but lack the typical structural features of organochlorine pesticides or industrial chemicals. The program's criteria were too broad, leading to false positives.

False negatives:
The program missed some valid organochlorine compounds due to the strict criteria for functional groups and molecular weight. For example:

- chlorimuron
- chloroprene
- procion red MX-5B
- 3-chloroprop-2-en-1-ol
- 3-Chloro-4-(isopropylsulfonyl)thiophene
- S-(chloromethyl)glutathione
- ... and a few others

These molecules are indeed organochlorine compounds but were missed because they lack the specific functional groups or have low molecular weights.

To improve the program, we need to refine the criteria for identifying organochlorine compounds. One approach could be to use a more comprehensive set of SMARTS patterns to capture a wider range of organochlorine functional groups and structural features. Additionally, we could incorporate machine learning techniques or use a curated dataset of known organochlorine compounds to train a more robust classification model.

Another approach could be to focus on specific subclasses of organochlorine compounds, such as organochlorine pesticides or industrial chemicals, and tailor the criteria accordingly. This would involve defining more specific structural features and functional groups characteristic of the target subclass.

Regardless of the approach, it is clear that the current program needs further refinement to improve its accuracy and avoid both false positives and false negatives.
