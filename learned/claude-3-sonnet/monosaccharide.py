"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35381 monosaccharide
"""
The previous program had some flaws that led to poor performance in classifying monosaccharides. Here are some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Carbonyl Group Detection**: The current method for detecting the carbonyl group (`has_carbonyl`) may not be sufficient. It checks for atoms with sp2 hybridization and a sum of bond orders equal to 2. However, this could also match other functional groups like amides or carboxylic acids. A more robust approach would be to use SMARTS patterns to specifically match aldehydes (`C=O`) and ketones (`C(=O)C`).

2. **Cyclic/Acyclic Differentiation**: The program assumes that if a ring is present, it must be a pyranose or furanose ring, which is not always the case. Monosaccharides can have other ring systems, and some non-monosaccharides may also contain pyranose or furanose rings. A better approach would be to check for specific monosaccharide skeletons (e.g., glucopyranose, arabinofuranose) using SMARTS patterns or substructure matching.

3. **Handling Deoxy and Substituted Monosaccharides**: The program focuses on the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-CH(O)-) but does not account for deoxy or substituted monosaccharides where some hydroxyl groups may be replaced by other groups. A more flexible approach would be to look for the overall carbon skeleton and functional groups, rather than relying solely on the number of hydroxyl groups.

4. **Molecular Weight and Size Considerations**: The program does not consider molecular weight or size constraints, which could be useful for ruling out very small or large molecules that are unlikely to be monosaccharides.

5. **False Positives and Negatives**: The current program seems to have a high rate of false positives (non-monosaccharides classified as monosaccharides) and false negatives (monosaccharides missed). Analyzing these cases in detail could provide insights for improving the classification rules and patterns.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Use more specific SMARTS patterns to match various monosaccharide skeletons (e.g., aldoses, ketoses, furanoses, pyranoses) and functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones).
2. Incorporate molecular weight and size constraints to filter out unlikely candidates.
3. Analyze false positives and false negatives from the previous run to identify potential pitfalls and refine the classification rules.
4. Consider using machine learning techniques (e.g., random forests, support vector machines) trained on a large dataset of monosaccharides and non-monosaccharides, as these may be able to capture more complex patterns and handle exceptions better than rule-based approaches.

Overall, a combination of more specific structural patterns, molecular descriptors, and potentially machine learning techniques could help improve the accuracy of monosaccharide classification.
