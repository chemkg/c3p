"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35381 monosaccharide
"""
Based on the failed outcomes, it seems the previous program had the following issues:

1. **Missing carbonyl group check for certain structures**: The program correctly identifies the presence of a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) as a requirement for monosaccharides. However, it misses some structures like D-arabinofuranose and D-glucopyranose because they lack a free carbonyl group in their cyclic forms.

2. **Strict hydroxyl group count check**: The program requires at least 3 hydroxyl groups, but some monosaccharides like (S)-3,4-dihydroxy-2-oxobutanoic acid, aldehydo-ascarylose, D-glyceraldehyde, and L-rhodinose have fewer than 3 hydroxyl groups.

3. **Incomplete monosaccharide skeleton patterns**: The program checks for certain aldose, ketose, furanose, and pyranose patterns, but these patterns may not cover all possible monosaccharide structures.

4. **Strict molecular weight and size constraints**: The program enforces strict molecular weight (100-400 Da) and size (5-20 atoms) constraints, which may exclude some valid monosaccharides.

To improve the program, we can consider the following:

1. **Expand carbonyl group check**: Instead of checking for free carbonyl groups, we can look for cyclic hemiacetal or hemiketal structures, which are common in monosaccharides.

2. **Relax hydroxyl group count check**: While monosaccharides typically have multiple hydroxyl groups, we should not strictly enforce a minimum count, as some valid monosaccharides may have fewer hydroxyl groups.

3. **Improve monosaccharide skeleton patterns**: We can use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns or a combination of patterns to cover a wider range of monosaccharide structures, including linear and cyclic forms.

4. **Remove strict molecular weight and size constraints**: These constraints may not be necessary, as monosaccharides can have a wide range of molecular weights and sizes, especially when considering substituted or modified forms.

5. **Consider additional checks**: We can explore other checks, such as the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, ether), ring strain, or stereochemistry, to further refine the classification.

6. **Use machine learning or database lookup**: As an alternative approach, we could train a machine learning model on a large dataset of monosaccharides, or use a comprehensive database of known monosaccharide structures for lookup and comparison.

By incorporating these improvements, we can create a more robust and accurate program for classifying monosaccharides based on their SMILES strings.
