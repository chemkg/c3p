"""
Classifies: CHEBI:15889 sterol
"""
The previous program made some reasonable attempts to identify sterol structures, but there are a few issues that led to poor performance:

1. **Hydroxy group count**: The program only checked for exactly one hydroxy group, but some sterol examples like 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol and 5alpha-androstane-3beta,6alpha,17beta-triol have multiple hydroxy groups.

2. **Steroid backbone patterns**: The steroid backbone patterns used were too specific to cholestane, cholane, ergostane, and ergostane scaffolds. Many other sterol examples have different backbones like lanostane, pregnane, etc.

3. **Cyclopropane ring check**: Checking for a cyclopropane ring is unnecessary, as not all sterols have this structural feature.

4. **Side chain check**: Simply checking for a generic alkyl side chain is not specific enough, as sterols typically have specific side chain patterns.

To improve the program, we need to take a more general approach to identifying the key structural features of sterols:

1. Check for the presence of a single hydroxy group attached to a cycloalkane ring system (not necessarily 3 fused rings).
2. Identify the characteristic tetracyclic ring system present in most sterols using a more general SMARTS pattern.
3. Look for specific side chain patterns commonly found in sterols, such as isopropyl, ethyl, methyl, or longer alkyl chains.
4. Consider additional criteria like molecular weight, lipophilicity, and other physicochemical properties typical of sterols.

By taking a more flexible and comprehensive approach to identifying the key structural features of sterols, we can hopefully improve the accuracy of the classification program.
