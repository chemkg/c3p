"""
Classifies: CHEBI:61907 medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program attempts to classify molecules as medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA by checking for the presence of the Coenzyme A substructure, an acyl group, and a fatty acid chain length between 6 and 12 carbon atoms. However, the outcomes show that it fails to correctly identify many valid examples of this class.

Here are some potential issues with the previous approach and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Rigid Coenzyme A substructure matching**: The program uses a SMARTS pattern to match the entire Coenzyme A substructure. However, this substructure can have different conformations and bond orders, leading to missed matches. A better approach would be to break down the substructure into smaller components and match them separately.

2. **Insufficient acyl group check**: The program only checks for the presence of a single acyl group (C(=O)). However, some examples contain additional acyl groups or other functionalities like esters or alcohols. A more robust approach would be to identify the specific acyl group attached to the Coenzyme A moiety and check for its connectivity.

3. **Oversimplified chain length check**: The program assumes that the aliphatic chain consists of only carbon atoms. However, some examples contain double bonds, substituents, or heteroatoms within the chain. A more accurate approach would be to identify the specific fatty acid chain attached to the acyl group and analyze its length and composition.

4. **Lack of stereochemistry consideration**: Many examples contain stereochemical information, which is not considered in the current approach. Incorporating stereochemistry checks could improve the classification accuracy.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. Identify the Coenzyme A substructure by breaking it down into smaller components and matching them separately. This could involve matching the ribose-phosphate backbone, the adenine base, and the pantothenate arm.

2. Identify the acyl group directly attached to the Coenzyme A moiety by traversing bonds from the thiol group.

3. Analyze the fatty acid chain attached to the acyl group by traversing bonds from the carbonyl carbon. Check the chain length, degree of unsaturation, and potential substituents or heteroatoms.

4. Consider incorporating stereochemistry checks by identifying stereogenic centers and matching the specified configuration.

5. Utilize additional structural features or properties, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or topological descriptors, to further refine the classification criteria.

By addressing these issues and incorporating more robust structural analysis techniques, the program's ability to accurately classify medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules should improve significantly.
