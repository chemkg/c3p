"""
Classifies: CHEBI:61907 medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program attempted to classify medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules by checking for the presence of the Coenzyme A substructure and a fatty acid chain of the appropriate length (6-12 carbons) attached to it. However, the approach had several limitations that led to the failure in classifying the provided examples correctly.

Here are some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Handling stereochemistry**: The program did not consider stereochemistry when matching the Coenzyme A substructure and the fatty acid chain. Many of the examples provided had specific stereochemistry, which was not accounted for in the SMARTS patterns used for substructure matching.

Improvement: Use more specific SMARTS patterns that take stereochemistry into account or consider using alternative methods for substructure matching that can handle stereochemistry, such as the `rdkit.Chem.AllChem.EmbedMolecule` function.

2. **Handling double bond configurations**: The program did not differentiate between cis and trans configurations of double bonds in the fatty acid chain. Some examples had specific double bond configurations (e.g., trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA, cis-dodec-3-enoyl-CoA), which were not recognized.

Improvement: Incorporate additional checks or SMARTS patterns to identify the double bond configurations in the fatty acid chain.

3. **Handling substituents and functional groups**: The program assumed that the fatty acid chain should only contain carbon and hydrogen atoms, but some examples had additional functional groups or substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, methyl, or thioether groups).

Improvement: Modify the program to allow for certain substituents or functional groups that are commonly found in medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules. This could be done by using more flexible SMARTS patterns or by incorporating additional checks for specific substituents or functional groups.

4. **Handling branched chains**: The program assumed a linear fatty acid chain, but some examples had branched structures (e.g., 2-methylhexenoyl-CoA, 2-methylhexanoyl-CoA).

Improvement: Modify the chain traversal algorithm to handle branched structures or use alternative methods for substructure matching that can handle branched structures more effectively.

5. **Handling additional components**: Some examples had additional components attached to the Coenzyme A substructure or the fatty acid chain (e.g., 3,5,7-trioxododecanoyl-CoA, 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA), which were not accounted for in the program.

Improvement: Consider incorporating additional checks or SMARTS patterns to identify and allow for common additional components that may be present in medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

6. **Handling edge cases**: The program did not account for some edge cases or special structures present in some examples (e.g., thioether in 3-thiaoctanoyl-CoA).

Improvement: Analyze the provided examples thoroughly and incorporate additional checks or patterns to handle any special cases or edge cases that may be present.

Overall, while the previous program had a good initial approach, it lacked the necessary complexity and specificity to handle the diverse range of structures present in the provided examples. Improving the program would involve a more comprehensive analysis of the examples, incorporating additional checks and patterns for specific structural features, and potentially exploring alternative methods for substructure matching and structure recognition.
