"""
Classifies: CHEBI:67142 nucleobase analogue
"""
The previous program had a few issues that led to the low performance:

1. **Incomplete nucleobase ring patterns**: The program only checked for a few common nucleobase ring systems (pyrimidine, pyrazine, purine, and imidazopyridine). However, there are many other possible ring systems that could be part of a nucleobase analogue, such as triazine, oxazine, or other fused ring systems.

2. **Overly strict modification criteria**: The program required the presence of at least one modification (amino, hydroxy, keto, etc.) on the nucleobase ring. However, some nucleobase analogues may not have these common modifications, or they may have different types of modifications not covered by the patterns.

3. **Glycosidic bond check not comprehensive**: The program only checked for a specific glycosidic bond pattern, which may not cover all possible configurations of nucleobase analogues compatible with nucleic acids.

4. **Overly strict criteria for nucleic acid compatibility**: The additional check for primary amine, carbonyl, and ring nitrogen was too strict and may have excluded valid nucleobase analogues that do not meet this specific criteria.

To improve the program, we can:

1. **Expand the nucleobase ring patterns**: Expand the list of SMARTS patterns to include a more comprehensive set of possible nucleobase ring systems, including fused rings and less common heterocyclic rings.

2. **Relax the modification criteria**: Instead of requiring the presence of specific modifications, we can check for any modification or substitution on the nucleobase ring, without being too specific about the type of modification.

3. **Use a more general glycosidic bond check**: Instead of a specific SMARTS pattern, we can use a more general approach to check for the presence of a glycosidic bond or potential glycosidic bond formation site.

4. **Remove the strict criteria for nucleic acid compatibility**: Instead of relying on specific functional group criteria, we can use a more general approach to assess the potential for nucleic acid compatibility, such as checking for reactive sites or functional groups that could participate in nucleic acid binding or substitution.

5. **Consider additional structural features**: Incorporate additional features or rules that can help identify nucleobase analogues, such as molecular weight, aromaticity, or specific substructure patterns.

By addressing these issues and incorporating a more flexible and comprehensive approach, the program's performance in classifying nucleobase analogues should improve significantly.
