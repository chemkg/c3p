"""
Classifies: CHEBI:17761 ceramide
"""
The previous code attempts to identify ceramides based on the presence of a sphingosine backbone and an amide-linked fatty acid chain. However, the outcomes show that it misses many true ceramide structures. Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Sphingosine backbone pattern**: The current SMARTS pattern for the sphingosine backbone `"[CH2X4][NX3][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH0X3]([OH1])[CH2X4]"` is too specific and does not account for variations in the sphingosine backbone, such as the presence of hydroxyl groups, double bonds, or substituents. Additionally, it only considers the core sphingosine structure and does not account for the possible presence of attached sugar moieties or other substituents.

Improvement: Use a more relaxed SMARTS pattern or a combination of patterns to capture the diverse variations in the sphingosine backbone. Consider allowing for the presence of additional substituents or attached groups.

2. **Fatty acid chain pattern**: The current SMARTS pattern for the fatty acid chain `"[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX4]([CH1X4])[CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4]"` is also quite specific and assumes a particular connectivity and atom hybridization states. It may miss some variations in the fatty acid chain, such as the presence of hydroxyl groups or other substituents.

Improvement: Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern or a combination of patterns to capture different representations of the fatty acid chain. Consider allowing for the presence of substituents or variations in the connectivity.

3. **Fatty acid chain length check**: The current approach checks the fatty acid chain length by counting the number of carbon atoms attached to a specific atom in the chain. This approach may be brittle and may not accurately capture branched or substituted fatty acid chains.

Improvement: Consider using more robust methods for determining the fatty acid chain length, such as parsing the SMILES or using a graph-based approach to traverse the carbon chain.

4. **Hydroxyl group on C2 of fatty acid chain**: The current approach for checking the presence of a hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the fatty acid chain may be too specific and may miss other representations of the same functionality.

Improvement: Consider using a more flexible approach to identify the presence of a hydroxyl or other substituent at the appropriate position in the fatty acid chain.

5. **Molecular weight check**: While the molecular weight check can be a useful heuristic, it may not be a strict requirement for all ceramide structures, especially for smaller or truncated ceramides.

Improvement: Consider relaxing or removing the molecular weight check, or use it as a secondary filter rather than a strict requirement.

6. **Additional structural features**: The current code does not consider other structural features that may be present in ceramide structures, such as additional sugar moieties, phosphate groups, or other substituents.

Improvement: Incorporate additional checks or patterns to account for these structural features, especially for more complex ceramide derivatives.

Overall, the previous code could benefit from a more flexible and comprehensive approach to identifying ceramide structures, considering the diverse variations and representations possible. Additionally, incorporating more advanced techniques such as substructure matching, graph-based analysis, or machine learning approaches could improve the accuracy and robustness of the ceramide classification.
