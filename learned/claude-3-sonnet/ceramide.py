After analyzing the previous code and the provided outcomes, it appears that the primary issue is the pattern used to identify the sphingosine backbone. The current pattern `"[CH2X4][NX3][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][OH1]"` is too specific and fails to match many of the provided examples.

The sphingosine backbone in ceramides can have variations, such as different chain lengths, unsaturations, and substituents. To address this issue, we need to use a more general pattern that can capture these variations.

Here are some suggestions for improving the program:

1. Use a more flexible pattern for the sphingosine backbone:
   - The pattern `"[CH2X4][NX3][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH0X3]([OH1])[CH2X4]"` allows for variations in the chain length and the presence of an optional hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon.
   - Alternatively, you could use a more general pattern like `"[CH2X4][NX3][CH2X4][CH2X4][CH2X4]"` and check for the presence of a hydroxyl group separately.

2. Consider handling additional variations:
   - Some examples have unsaturated bonds in the sphingosine backbone, which the current pattern does not account for.
   - Some examples have additional substituents (e.g., sulfate, phosphate) attached to the sphingosine backbone.

3. Check for the presence of a fatty acid chain:
   - Instead of looking for the amide pattern `"C(=O)N"`, you could search for a longer pattern that includes the fatty acid chain.
   - This would help ensure that the amide is connected to a proper fatty acid chain and not just any amide group.

4. Incorporate additional checks:
   - Check the carbon chain length of the fatty acid separately, as some examples have longer chains than the current range of 14-26 carbons.
   - Check for the presence of a hydroxyl group on the C2 position of the fatty acid chain, as this is a common feature of ceramides.

5. Consider using additional filtering criteria:
   - Molecular weight or atom count ranges could help filter out false positives or negatives.
   - Checking for specific functional groups or substituents that are common in ceramides could improve accuracy.

By addressing these points, you should be able to improve the performance of the `is_ceramide` function and better classify the provided examples.
