"""
Classifies: CHEBI:13248 anilide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify anilides by looking for the following substructures:

1. A benzene ring
2. An amide group attached to the benzene ring
3. The amide nitrogen being acylated (i.e., having a carbonyl group attached)

However, the results show that this approach has some limitations and misclassifies several molecules.

Here are some potential issues and ways to improve the program:

1. **False positives**: The program classifies some molecules as anilides even though they do not contain an aromatic amide obtained by acylation of aniline. This could be because the substructure search patterns are too broad and match other molecular scaffolds. To address this, we may need to add additional constraints or use more specific SMARTS patterns.

2. **False negatives**: The program misses some valid anilides because the substructure search patterns are too strict. For example, it fails to recognize anilides where the benzene ring or the amide group is part of a larger fused ring system or has additional substituents.

3. **Ring aromaticity**: The program assumes that the benzene ring is aromatic, but it does not explicitly check for aromaticity. There could be cases where the ring is non-aromatic or has a different ring size, leading to misclassification.

4. **Acylation check**: The program checks for acylation of the amide nitrogen by looking for a carbonyl group attached to it. However, this might not be sufficient, as there could be other types of acylation or more complex substituents.

To improve the program, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Use more specific SMARTS patterns**: Instead of searching for individual substructures, we can try to define a more specific SMARTS pattern that captures the essential features of an anilide. This could involve combining multiple substructure constraints into a single pattern.

2. **Implement a recursive approach**: Instead of relying on substructure searches, we can recursively analyze the molecular structure, starting from the benzene ring and following the bonds to identify the amide group and check for acylation.

3. **Incorporate additional checks**: We can add more checks to ensure that the benzene ring is aromatic, the amide group is part of an aromatic system, and the acylation meets specific criteria (e.g., check for specific substituents or functional groups).

4. **Use machine learning models**: If the structural rules for anilide classification are too complex or have too many exceptions, we can consider training a machine learning model on a dataset of known anilides and non-anilides to learn the patterns automatically.

5. **Combine multiple approaches**: We can combine different approaches, such as substructure searches, recursive analysis, and machine learning models, to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the classification.

Ultimately, the choice of approach will depend on the complexity of the problem, the availability of training data, and the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
