"""
Classifies: CHEBI:65111 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-)
"""
After analyzing the previous code and the outcomes, it appears that the program is not correctly identifying the 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) structures. The main issue seems to be with the CoA(4-) backbone pattern and the handling of double bonds in the acyl chain.

Here are the potential improvements:

1. **CoA(4-) backbone pattern**: The current CoA(4-) backbone pattern is too specific and does not account for double bonds in the acyl chain. It should be modified to allow for double bonds and different stereochemistry configurations.

2. **Double bond handling**: The code currently does not handle double bonds in the acyl chain correctly. It assumes a linear chain of carbon atoms, but many examples contain double bonds. A new approach is needed to identify and handle double bonds in the acyl chain.

3. **Acyl chain length check**: The current approach to check the acyl chain length by counting the number of carbon atoms may not work for structures with double bonds. A different method, such as calculating the number of heavy atoms or using a more general pattern, might be more robust.

4. **Stereochemistry handling**: While the current code checks for the correct stereochemistry of the CoA(4-) backbone, it does not consider the stereochemistry of the acyl chain. Some examples might require checking the stereochemistry of the double bonds in the acyl chain.

5. **Negative charge check**: The negative charge check seems reasonable, but it might be worth double-checking the logic to ensure it is correct for all cases.

To improve the program, you could try the following steps:

1. Modify the CoA(4-) backbone pattern to be more general and allow for double bonds and different stereochemistry configurations.
2. Develop a new approach to identify and handle double bonds in the acyl chain, possibly using a more general pattern or substructure matching.
3. Revise the acyl chain length check to use a more robust method, such as counting the number of heavy atoms or using a more general pattern.
4. Consider checking the stereochemistry of the double bonds in the acyl chain, if necessary.
5. Double-check the negative charge check logic to ensure it is correct for all cases.

By addressing these issues, the program should be able to more accurately classify the 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) structures.
