    Attempts to classify a molecule as a 'mucopolysaccharide' based on its SMILES string.
    Given examples do not fit traditional mucopolysaccharide patterns based on classical definitions.
    This function checks for certain characteristics these examples may have.

        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule appears to fit the example set given, False otherwise.
