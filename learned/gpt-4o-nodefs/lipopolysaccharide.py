    Determines if a molecule is a lipopolysaccharide based on its SMILES string.
    Due to the complexity and diversity of lipopolysaccharide structures, this 
    classification is non-trivial and likely cannot be effectively performed using 
    simple SMILES pattern matching. The task requires detailed molecular analysis 
    beyond typical usage of cheminformatics tools like RDKit.
