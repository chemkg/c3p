Classifies: A very long-chain fatty acid
Definition: A fatty acid which has a chain length greater than C22.
            Very long-chain fatty acids which have a chain length greater than C27 
            are also known as ultra-long-chain fatty acids.
The function is_very_long_chain_fatty_acid takes a SMILES string as input and 
returns a tuple: (bool, reason)

def is_very_long_chain_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) based on its SMILES string.
    
    Our approach:
      1. Parse the SMILES string into an RDKit molecule.
      2. Check for the presence of a carboxylic acid group using two SMARTS patterns 
         (protonated and deprotonated).
      3. Verify that the moleculeâ€™s heavy-atom composition is predominantly carbon.
      4. For each acid group found, start from the acid carbon and compute the longest acyclic 
         chain length by following only carbon atoms that are not part of any ring.
      5. If the maximum chain length (number of connected carbons, including the acid carbon)
         is greater than 22, the molecule qualifies as a very long-chain fatty acid.
         If the chain length is also greater than 27, we note that it is an ultra-long-chain species.

        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a very long-chain fatty acid, False otherwise.
