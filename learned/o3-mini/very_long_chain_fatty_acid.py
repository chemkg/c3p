Classifies: A very long-chain fatty acid
Definition: A fatty acid which has a chain length greater than C22.
            Very long-chain fatty acids which have a chain length greater than C27 are also known as ultra-long-chain fatty acids.
The function is_very_long_chain_fatty_acid takes a SMILES string as input and returns a tuple: (bool, reason)

def is_very_long_chain_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a very long-chain fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    
    Our approach:
      1. Parse the SMILES string into an RDKit molecule.
      2. Check for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
          We use the SMARTS pattern 'C(=O)[O;H]' â€“ note that in RDKit hydrogens may be implicit,
          so this pattern is a heuristic to ensure a carboxyl function is present.
      3. Count the number of carbon atoms (atomic number 6) as a proxy for the fatty acid chain length.
         (This simple approach assumes that the majority of carbons are in the acyl chain.)
      4. If the total carbon count is greater than 22 then we classify the compound as a very 
         long-chain fatty acid. If the count exceeds 27 we note that this is in the ultra-long-chain range.

    Returns:
