Classifies: secondary alcohol
Definition: A secondary alcohol is a compound in which a hydroxyl group (-OH)
is attached to a saturated (sp3) carbon that bears exactly two carbon substituents and one hydrogen.
This function uses RDKit to parse the SMILES string, add explicit hydrogens,
and then searches for a carbon atom meeting these conditions.

    Determines if a molecule contains at least one secondary alcohol group.
    
    A secondary alcohol is defined as a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an sp3 carbon atom 
    that has exactly one hydrogen and exactly two other carbon substituents (for a total of 4 neighbors).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
