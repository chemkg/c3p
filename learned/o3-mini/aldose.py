Classifies: CHEBI:15693 aldose

"""
Classifies: Aldose â€“ Aldehydic parent sugars (polyhydroxy aldehydes H[CH(OH)]nC(=O)H, n>=2) and their intramolecular hemiacetals.
Examples include beta-D-idopyranose, D-ribofuranose, L-erythrose, beta-D-glucose, etc.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldose based on its SMILES string.
    Aldoses are defined as polyhydroxy aldehydes (H[CH(OH)]nC(=O)H with n>=2) or their cyclic hemiacetal forms.
    Typically, aldoses have between 3 and 7 carbon atoms.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
