Classifies: CHEBI:75769 B vitamin
"""
"""
Classifies: B vitamin compounds (vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12)
Note: Vitamin B forms are structurally diverse. This implementation uses substructure
patterns designed to catch key features of some known B vitamins. These include a
check for cobalt (for B12) and a set of simplified SMARTS patterns for the others.
