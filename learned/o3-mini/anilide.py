"""
Classifies: Anilide 
Definition: Anilide is any aromatic amide obtained by acylation of aniline.
That is, the amide (C(=O)-N) group must have the acyl carbon attached to nitrogen and
the nitrogen must be directly bonded (as a substituent) to an aromatic (benzene-type) ring.
Additionally, we require that aside from the carbonyl carbon, the amide nitrogen (which
originally belonged to aniline) has no extra heavy substituents.

    Determines if a molecule is an anilide based on its SMILES string.
    Anilides are aromatic amides formed by acylation of aniline,
