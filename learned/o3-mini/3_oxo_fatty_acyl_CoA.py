Classifies: 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA

An oxo fatty acyl-CoA results from the condensation of the thiol group of
coenzyme A with the carboxyl group of a 3-oxo fatty acid. The hallmark motif
is that the fatty acyl chain contains two carbonyl groups separated by one 
intervening aliphatic carbon, and the acyl chain is attached via a thioester bond 
to the CoA moiety.

def is_3_oxo_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    The steps are:
      1. Parse the SMILES and check overall formal charge is zero.
      2. Look for a Coenzyme A moiety using a characteristic SMARTS pattern.
      3. Look for a 3-oxo fatty acyl fragment. Here we demand that a 
         linear (or near linear) acyl fragment matches a pattern:
           [#6;!A](=O) [C;!A] [C;!A](=O)[S]
         That is, a carbonyl carbon (non‚Äêaromatic), a bridging aliphatic carbon,
         and a second carbonyl directly attached to a thioester S atom.
         For at least one such match we further require that one of its atoms is
         directly bonded to an atom from the CoA fragment.
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        (bool, str):
          bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA,
                False otherwise.
