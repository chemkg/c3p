    Determines if a molecule is a tricarboxylic acid based on its SMILES string.
    
    A tricarboxylic acid is defined as an oxoacid containing three carboxy groups.
    Carboxyl groups are identified here by the substructure C(=O)O in the protonated form
    or C(=O)[O-] in the deprotonated form.
