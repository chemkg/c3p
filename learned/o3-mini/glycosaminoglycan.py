Classifies: CHEBI:18085 glycosaminoglycan

"""
Classifies: Glycosaminoglycan
Definition: Any polysaccharide containing a substantial proportion of aminomonosaccharide residues.
Heuristic: Identify candidate sugar rings (5 or 6‚Äêmembered rings containing one oxygen)
           then check if the ring has a substituent that is an amino group.
           The molecule is classified as a glycosaminoglycan if it has at least 2 candidate sugar rings
           and at least 30% of these show amino substitution.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a glycosaminoglycan based on its SMILES string.
    
    Glycosaminoglycans are defined as polysaccharides (multiple repeating carbohydrate units)
    that contain a substantial proportion of aminomonosaccharide residues. As a heuristic,
    we look for candidate sugar rings -- defined here as 5- or 6-membered rings with exactly one ring oxygen --
    and among these, we consider a ring an aminomonosaccharide if at least one of its ring atoms
    bears a substituent nitrogen (i.e. not part of the ring).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as glycosaminoglycan, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
