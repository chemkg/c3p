Classifies: Acyl-CoA
Definition: An acyl-CoA is a thioester that results from the formal condensation

Example structures include pimeloyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, etc.

    Determines if a molecule is an acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    Acyl-CoA is defined as a thioester (R-C(=O)S-) resulting from the condensation
    of the thiol group of coenzyme A with a carboxylic acid. 
    A valid acyl-CoA should contain:
      - A thioester functional group (C(=O)S).
      - A CoA nucleotide moiety â€“ typically an adenine ring (which may appear with various substituents).
      - Multiple phosphate groups (commonly found in the CoA portion).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
