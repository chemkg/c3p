Classifies: Acyl-CoA
Definition: An acyl-CoA is a thioester that results from the formal condensation of 
the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of any carboxylic acid.

    Determines if a molecule is an acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    An acyl-CoA is defined as a thioester (R-C(=O)S-) resulting from the condensation
    of the thiol group of coenzyme A with a carboxylic acid.  Its structure should include:
      - A thioester functional group (C(=O)S).
      - A CoA nucleotide moietyâ€”which can be recognized either by the presence of an adenine
        ring (which may appear with various bond orders and substituents) or a part of the pantetheine fragment.
      - Multiple phosphate groups (commonly 2 or more) as part of the nucleotide chain.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
