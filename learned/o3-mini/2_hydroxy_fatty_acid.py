def is_2_hydroxy_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 2-hydroxy fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    A 2-hydroxy fatty acid is defined as a fatty acid containing a carboxylic acid group
    and an -OH substituent on the carbon alpha (adjacent) to that carboxyl group.
    
    The procedure is:
      1. Parse the SMILES and add explicit hydrogens.
      2. Check that the molecule has at least one carboxylic acid group.
      3. For each carboxyl group found, retrieve the carbon atom and examine its (non-oxygen)
         neighbors â€“ i.e. candidates for the alpha carbon. For each such candidate, check
         if it has any oxygen atom attached that carries an explicit hydrogen (i.e. an -OH).
      4. Also enforce that the molecule is acyclic (common for simple fatty acids) and that
         it has a sufficient number of carbons.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 2-hydroxy fatty acid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
