Classifies: inositol phosphoceramide
Definition:
  A phosphosphingolipid in which an inositol residue and the ceramide moiety 
  are linked via a phosphodiester bridge. The ceramide moiety contains 
  substituents R(1) and R(2) which vary with different sphingoid bases and 
  fatty acyl moieties.
  
Detection strategy:
  1. Use SMARTS queries to detect an inositol substructure (a cyclohexanol with 6 hydroxyl groups)
     and an amide function (as indicative of the ceramide part).
  2. Identify phosphorus atoms and for each such atom, check:
       a. At least one oxygen neighbor is part of an inositol match.
       b. At least one oxygen neighbor (via its bonded atom) is part of an amide match.
  3. Verify that the molecule has many carbons and a fair number of rotatable bonds 
     (to ensure the presence of long aliphatic chains).
  
If these criteria are met, the compound is classified as an inositol phosphoceramide.
 
Note: The SMARTS for the inositol pattern is specific and may not catch every variant,
but it seems to match many of the examples provided.

def is_inositol_phosphoceramide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an inositol phosphoceramide based on its SMILES string.
    
    Detection steps:
      1. Pre-match an inositol group using a SMARTS pattern typical for cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol.
      2. Pre-match an amide motif (C(=O)N) considered part of the ceramide moiety.
      3. Loop over every phosphorus atom in the molecule. For each phosphorus, look at its oxygen neighbors:
             a. One of the oxygens must belong to an inositol substructure.
             b. One oxygen (or another neighboring atom in the oxygenâ€™s bonds) must be part of an amide motif.
      4. Also check that there are enough carbon atoms and rotatable bonds to support long acyl chains.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule meets the inositol phosphoceramide criteria, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the decision.
