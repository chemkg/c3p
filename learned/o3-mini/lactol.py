Classifies: lactol

Definition:
  Lactols (cyclic hemiacetals) are formed by the intramolecular addition of a hydroxy group to a 
  carbonyl resulting in a cyclic structure where the (former carbonyl) carbon bears two oxygen substituents:
  one coming from an exocyclic hydroxyl (-OH) and one as part of the ring (an acetal linkage). In our heuristic,
  the candidate lactol carbon is required to be in a ring and to be attached to exactly two oxygen atoms:
  one of which is exocyclic and displays at least one explicit hydrogen, and one that is a ring oxygen.
  Furthermore, the lactol carbon and its ring oxygen neighbor must belong together to a 5- or 6-membered ring.
  
Note:
  This improved heuristic attempts to reduce false positives (e.g. in large glycosylated structures)
  while still detecting common lactol motifs (including simple sugars like alpha-D-fructopyranose)
  and more complex natural products. It may still fail on unusual structures.

def is_lactol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a lactol (cyclic hemiacetal) based on its SMILES string.
    
    A lactol (cyclic hemiacetal) is produced by the intramolecular addition of a hydroxy group to a carbonyl 
    (aldehydic or ketonic) center, yielding a ring in which that carbon (the candidate lactol carbon) is bound 
    to exactly two oxygen atoms: one as part of the ring (forming an acetal linkage) and one as an exocyclic -OH.
    In this heuristic:
      - The candidate lactol carbon (a sp3 carbon in a ring) must have exactly two heavy-atom oxygen neighbors.
      - Out of these, one oxygen must be in a ring and the other must be exocyclic and show a directly attached hydrogen.
      - In addition, the candidate carbon and its ring oxygen neighbor must share a ring of size 5 or 6.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a lactol, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the decision.
