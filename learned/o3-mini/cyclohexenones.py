    Determines if a molecule is a cyclohexenone based on its SMILES string.
    A cyclohexenone is defined as a six-membered alicyclic (i.e. non-aromatic) ring, all carbon atoms,
    with one ketone functional group (a carbon (in the ring) double-bonded to O) and exactly one double bond
    (C=C) within the ring.
