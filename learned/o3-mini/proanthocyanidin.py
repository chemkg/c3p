Classifies: Proanthocyanidin 
A proanthocyanidin is defined as a flavonoid oligomer 
obtained by the condensation of two or more units of hydroxyflavans.
This program uses a few heuristic criteria:
  1. The molecular weight must be at least 500 Da (monomers are much smaller).
  2. The molecule should contain several ring systems.
  3. At least two substructure matches of a simplified flavan (catechin) unit are required.
Note: This is a heuristic approach and may not catch all edge cases.
