"""
Classifies: L-alpha-amino acid
Definition: Any alpha-amino acid having L-configuration at the alpha-carbon.
A free (nonpeptidic) L-alpha-amino acid should have exactly one motif of the form:
    [NH2,NH3+]-[C@H or C@@H]([*])C(=O)[O or O-]
with the amino nitrogen free (not amidated) and the carboxyl group as a free acid.
In addition, the CIP code for the chiral (alpha) carbon should be 'S' (L configuration).
