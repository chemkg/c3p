Classifies: Spiroketal
Definition: A cyclic ketal in which the ketal (spiro) carbon is the only common atom of two rings.
Improvements:
 - The candidate spiro center (carbon) is required to be sp3‚Äêhybridized and not part of a carbonyl.
 - The candidate carbon must have exactly two oxygen substituents via single bonds.
 - Instead of only checking that there is a pair of rings that share the candidate (the minimum definition
   of a spiro center), we ensure that for at least one pair of rings that only share the candidate,
   one oxygen substituent is present exclusively in one ring and the other oxygen exclusively in the other.

    Determines if a molecule is a spiroketal based on its SMILES string.
    
    A spiroketal is defined as a cyclic ketal in which:
     - The ketal (spiro) carbon is sp3-hybridized and not part of a carbonyl.
     - The spiro carbon has exactly two oxygen (OR) substituents via single bonds.
     - There exists at least one pair of rings that share only the candidate carbon, and in these rings,
       one oxygen substituent is present in one ring and the other in the other ring.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a spiroketal, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
