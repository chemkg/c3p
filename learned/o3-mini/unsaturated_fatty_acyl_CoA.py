Classifies: Unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA
Definition: A fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of any unsaturated fatty acid.
This function checks for a thioester group (indicating linkage between acyl and CoA), a CoA moiety (using an adenine SMARTS pattern),
and finally the presence of at least one nonaromatic carbonâ€“carbon double bond (indicating unsaturation in the fatty acid part).

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    The criteria used are:
      1. The molecule must be parsed successfully.
      2. It must contain a thioester group, i.e. a carbonyl (C=O) attached to a sulfur (S), 
         which is the signature of the linkage to CoA.
      3. It must contain a CoA moiety.
         Here we look for a characteristic purine/adenine ring pattern found in CoA.
      4. The fatty acyl chain must be unsaturated.
         We count the number of nonaromatic C=C bonds in the molecule.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
