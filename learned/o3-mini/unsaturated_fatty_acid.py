"""
Classifies: Unsaturated Fatty Acid
Definition: A fatty acid (i.e. a molecule with exactly one terminal carboxyl 
group on an aliphatic (acyclic) chain) that has at least one C=C or C#C bond.
Note: This heuristic rejects molecules with multiple acid groups or acid groups 
embedded inside rings.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an unsaturated fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    A valid unsaturated fatty acid must (a) contain exactly one terminal (acyclic) carboxyl group, 
    and (b) have at least one carbonâ€“carbon double or triple bond.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
