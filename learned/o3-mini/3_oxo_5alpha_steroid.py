Classifies: CHEBI: 3-oxo-5alpha-steroid
Definition: A 3-oxo steroid that has alpha configuration at position 5.
Heuristic (improved):
  (1) The molecule must contain at least one ketone group (C=O) on a ring.
  (2) The molecule must contain a steroid nucleus: a fused system of 4 rings (exactly one five-membered ring and three six-membered rings) composed solely of carbon atoms and whose union has exactly 17 carbons.
  (3) At least one atom in the nucleus must be marked with a chiral tag.
Note: This heuristic approach tries to limit combinatorial searches by first filtering candidate rings and then working only on connected ring systems.

    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-5alpha-steroid based on its SMILES string.
    Heuristics:
      - The molecule must have a ketone group (C=O) on a ring.
      - The molecule must contain a fused steroid nucleus: a set of 4 rings, exactly one five-membered

      - At least one atom in the nucleus must have explicit chiral annotation.
