Classifies: 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol
Definition: A phosphatidylinositol in which the inositol moiety is the 1D-myo isomer
            and the phosphatidyl group is located at its position 1.
The function is_1_phosphatidyl_1D_myo_inositol takes a SMILES string and returns a boolean
and a reason for the classification.

def is_1_phosphatidyl_1D_myo_inositol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether a molecule (given as a SMILES string) is a 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol.
    
    The approach here is to check three structural features:
    1. The molecule must contain an inositol moiety having the arrangement of hydroxyl groups
       characteristic of 1D-myo-inositol. (We use a SMARTS pattern that matches a cyclohexane
       ring bearing six hydroxyl groups with stereochemistry typical for D-myo-inositol.)
    2. One of the hydroxyl groups (the one corresponding to position 1) must be substituted
       (acylated) by a phosphate group. In other words, an oxygen of the inositol ring must be
       directly bonded to a phosphorus atom having the typical P(=O)(O)O fragment.
    3. In phosphatidylinositols the phosphate group is connected to a diacylglycerol unit;
       here we search for at least two ester (acyl) groups (i.e. a C(=O)Oâ€“ fragment not directly
       linked to P) as a proxy for the acyl chains.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol, False otherwise.
        str: A reason message explaining the classification result.
