Classifies: Monoradylglycerol
Definition:
   Any lipid that is glycerol bearing a single acyl, alkyl or alk-1-enyl substituent
   at an unspecified position.
Our revised approach:
 1. Parse the SMILES and add explicit hydrogens.
 2. Look over all sp3 carbon atoms to find a potential glycerol backbone.
    The candidate backbone is defined by a central sp3 carbon with at least two sp3 carbon neighbors (the terminals)
    which themselves are not directly connected.
 3. For each of these three carbons (backbone atoms), collect any oxygen neighbors (outside the backbone).
 4. If a backbone carbon has no oxygen neighbor, this candidate fails.
 5. When there is more than one oxygen neighbor, choose oneâ€”if one oxygen lacks hydrogens (i.e. is substituted) then choose that one.
 6. In the candidate backbone the classification criteria is that exactly two of the chosen oxygens are free hydroxyl groups
    (i.e. have at least one hydrogen) and exactly one is substituted (no hydrogen).
 7. For the substituted oxygen, follow its non-backbone neighbor (which should be carbon) and compute
    the longest chain length. If that chain has at least 6 carbons, this is taken as a fatty substituent.
 8. If any candidate passes, return True with a message. Otherwise, return False.
