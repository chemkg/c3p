Classifies: Long-chain fatty acid (chain length ranging from C13 to C22)

A long-chain fatty acid is defined as a fatty acid with a chain length
ranging from C13 to C22. In our implementation, we require that the molecule
contains a terminal carboxylic acid group (â€“C(=O)O, where the acid proton might
be implicit or expressed as a negative charge) and that the longest continuous carbon
chain containing that carboxyl group (i.e. starting at its unique carbon neighbor)
has a total length (including the carboxyl carbon) between 13 and 22.

    Determines if a molecule is a long-chain fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    
    A long-chain fatty acid is defined as a fatty acid with a chain length ranging 
    from C13 to C22. Here we require that the molecule contains a terminal carboxyl group,
    which we (heuristically) define as the presence of a carboxyl moiety ([CX3](=O)[OX1])
    whose carbon (the acid carbon) is attached to exactly one other carbon atom. Then, 
    we compute the longest continuous carbon chain (via a DFS on the carbon-only graph)
    that is attached to that acid group. If the chain length (including the acid carbon)
    is between 13 and 22 (inclusive), we return True.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a long-chain fatty acid, False otherwise.
