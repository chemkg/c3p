Classifies: CHEBI:26493 quinic acid

"""
Classifies: Quinic acid â€“ a cyclitol carboxylic acid derivative.
A quinic acid derivative is defined as having an isolated (i.e. non-fused)
saturated cyclohexane ring (all carbons, all single bonds) that displays exactly
one exocyclic carboxyl group (with neutral oxygen atoms) and at least four oxygen substituents.
This heuristic attempts to avoid false positives from fused-ring molecules.

def is_quinic_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a quinic acid derivative (cyclitol carboxylic acid derivative)
    based on its SMILES string.
    The algorithm:
      (1) Searches for a saturated cyclohexane (six-carbon) ring.
      (2) Ensures that the ring is not fused with any other ring (i.e. it is isolated).
      (3) Looks for exactly one exocyclic carboxyl group (as defined by a carbon
          that is sp2 and bound to one double-bonded oxygen and one single-bonded oxygen, both neutral).
      (4) Requires at least four oxygen substituents from the ring carbons.
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is recognized as a quinic acid derivative, False otherwise.
        str: A reason describing the outcome.
