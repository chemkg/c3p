Classifies: diglyceride 
Definition: A glyceride that is glycerol in which any two of the hydroxy groups have been acylated.
That is, two of the positions have an ester group (an oxygen attached to a carbonyl carbon) while
the remaining position is free (OH or substituted with an alkyl group).

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a diglyceride based on its SMILES string.
    A diglyceride is a glyceride in which exactly two of the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol
    are acylated (i.e. have been converted to esters). The remaining group is left free (OH or alkyl).
    
    Args:
