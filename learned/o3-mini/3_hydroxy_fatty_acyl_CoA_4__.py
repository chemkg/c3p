Classifies: 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
Definition:
  "An acyl-CoA(4-) oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups 
   of any 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3."

This version improves on a previous attempt by:
  • Using a SMARTS pattern for the 3-hydroxy fatty acyl chain that ignores stereochemistry (via [CX3](O)CC(=O)S)
    and then filtering out candidates where the –OH bearing carbon is directly bonded to an aromatic carbon.
  • Ensuring that the CoA moiety fragment (“SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)”) is present.
  • Counting deprotonated oxygens in two ways:
       - via formal charges on oxygen atoms in the molecule,
       - via a literal count of "[O-]" in the input SMILES.
    In case both counts return zero but the molecule contains phosphorus (and hence a phosphate group)
    we assume the deprotonation occurred.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-) based on its SMILES string.
    
    The molecule must contain:
      - A 3-hydroxy fatty acyl chain. We look for a substructure 
        that matches a carbon with an –OH followed by 2 carbons (the second being the thioester carbonyl)
        i.e. a fragment matching "[CX3](O)CC(=O)S". In addition, we inspect the candidate so that the 
        hydroxyl-bearing carbon is not directly attached to an aromatic carbon (which would be more typical for 
        a substituted aromatic acyl chain rather than a fatty acyl chain).
      - A CoA moiety defined by the fragment "SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)".
      - At least 4 deprotonated oxygens. We count oxygens carrying a -1 formal charge (via RDKit) 
        and also count literal occurrences of "[O-]" in the SMILES. In case both return zero but phosphorus
        atoms are present (as a proxy for a phosphate/diphosphate group) we assume that the CoA would be deprotonated.
    
    Returns:
        (bool, str): A tuple where the first element is True (if the molecule meets all criteria) 
                     or False otherwise, and the second element is a string explaining the decision.
