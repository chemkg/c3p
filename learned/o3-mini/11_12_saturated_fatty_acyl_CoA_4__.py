Classifies: CHEBI:84947 â€“ 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
Definition:
   Any fatty acyl-CoA(4-) in which the 11-12 bond of the fatty acyl group is saturated.

def is_11_12_saturated_fatty_acyl_CoA_4__(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether the given SMILES string corresponds to an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-).
    We first check that the molecule contains a CoA-like fragment and a thioester linkage.
    Then we follow the fatty acyl chain in a strictly linear fashion (rejecting chains with branches)
    starting from the carbonyl carbon (C1). Finally, we check that the bond between C11 and C12 (numbered from C1)
    is a single bond; that is, the 11-12 bond is saturated.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule meets the criteria, False otherwise.
