    """
    Determines whether the given SMILES string corresponds to an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-).
    This is defined as a fatty acyl-CoA (i.e. a molecule with a thioester linkage attached to a CoA-like fragment)
    for which the fatty acyl chain (starting at the carbonyl carbon) has its 11-12 bond (i.e. between the 11th and 12th carbon)
    saturated (single bond).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), else False.
