Classifies: CHEBI:84947 â€“ 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
Definition:
   Any fatty acyl-CoA(4-) in which the 11-12 bond of the fatty acyl group is saturated.
   (Carbon numbering for the acyl group starts at the carbonyl carbon, which is C1.)
Improved strategy:
  1. Check for CoA by requiring both a thioester linkage ([CX3](=O)[S]) and a purine-like fragment 
     (n1cnc2c(ncnc12)) that is present in CoA(4-).
  2. Starting from the thioester (carbonyl carbon), use a DFS search to find the longest linear chain 
     of carbons (thus capturing the main fatty acyl chain even with small branches).
  3. Confirm that the chain is long enough (>= 12 carbons) and that the bond between carbon 11 and 
     carbon 12 is a single (saturated) bond.

    """
    Determines whether the given SMILES string corresponds to an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-).
    
    Steps:
       - Check that the molecule is valid.
       - Verify that it contains a CoA-like fragment (using a thioester SMARTS and a purine-ring SMARTS).
       - Locate the thioester group. Assume the carbonyl carbon in the match is C1.
       - From the thioester, perform a DFS search (over carbon atoms only) to find the longest simple carbon chain.
       - Verify that the chain has at least 12 carbons and check that specifically the bond between 
         carbon 11 and 12 (i.e. chain indices 10 and 11 with C1 as index 0) is a single bond.

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule qualifies as an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), False otherwise.
