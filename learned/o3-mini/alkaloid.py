"""
Classifies: Alkaloid
Definition: Any of the naturally occurring, basic nitrogen compounds (mostly heterocyclic) found
mostly in the plant kingdom (but also in bacteria, fungi, and animals). By extension, certain neutral
compounds biogenetically related to basic alkaloids are also classed as alkaloids.
Note: Compounds in which the nitrogen is exocyclic (for example dopamine, mescaline, serotonin, etc.)
are usually classed as amines â€“ however, some molecules (e.g. selegiline, ephedrine) are accepted alkaloids.
This heuristic now requires that at least one nitrogen is either (a) part of a ring or (b) 
exocyclic but directly attached to an aromatic atom.

def is_alkaloid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a given molecule (SMILES) is likely an alkaloid using an improved heuristic.
    The heuristic criteria are:
      1) SMILES must be valid (i.e. parseable).
      2) The molecule must have at least one nitrogen atom.
      3) At least one nitrogen atom must either be part of a ring (typically heterocyclic) OR, if exocyclic,
         it should be directly bonded to an aromatic atom.
         
    Args:
      smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
      
    Returns:
      bool: True if the molecule is alkaloid-like, False otherwise.
      str: Explanation for the decision.
