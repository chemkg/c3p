Classifies: CHEBI:1624 3-oxo-5beta-steroid
"""
"""
Classifies: 3-oxo-5beta-steroid, defined as 'Any 3-oxo steroid that has beta- configuration at position 5.' 
Heuristic criteria revised:
  1. Identify all ring systems from the input molecule.
  2. Build a graph of fused rings (rings sharing at least 2 atoms) and search for a connected component
     that has exactly 4 rings and whose ring sizes are exactly three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring.
     (This represents the canonical steroid nucleus, i.e. cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene.)
  3. Check that at least one of the carbons in that candidate nucleus bears a double-bonded oxygen (a ketone) 
     â€“ which should be a ring-bound carbonyl (the "3-oxo" feature).
  4. As a proxy for the beta configuration at carbon-5, require that the SMILES string includes at least one "@@" annotation.
     
Note: Since steroid numbering is nontrivial from a SMILES string, these conditions are all heuristic.

def is_3_oxo_5beta_steroid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule appears to be a 3-oxo-5beta-steroid based on its SMILES string.
    
    The heuristic:
      (a) Parse the molecule and extract all ring systems.
      (b) Build a connectivity graph among rings that share at least 2 atoms. Then search for a connected
          set of rings that has exactly 4 fused rings, consisting of 3 six-membered rings and 1 five-membered ring.
      (c) Check that within the candidate steroid nucleus there is at least one ring-bound ketone (C=O).
      (d) Verify that the original SMILES string contains an explicit chiral tag ("@@") that is assumed to
          indicate the beta configuration at position 5.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule fits the heuristic criteria for a 3-oxo-5beta-steroid, False otherwise.
