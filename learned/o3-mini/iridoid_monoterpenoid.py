Classifies: CHEBI:50563 iridoid monoterpenoid

Below is one possible revised solution. In our reasoning we noticed that simply “detecting” a fused 5‐membered ring and a 6‐membered (putative “pyran”) ring via ring counting produces both false‐positives (many other fused bicyclic systems also exist) and false‐negatives (some “iridoid” or secoiridoid cores do not have a “perfect” oxygen‐containing six‐membered ring). One way to improve our detection is to try to “capture” the canonical iridoid structural motif—that is, the cyclopenta[c]pyran core—with a sub‐structure query. In the code below we use one SMARTS for the “classical” core (with an oxygen in the six‐membered ring) and if that does not match then we try a second query that lacks the oxygen (a “secoiridoid‐like” variant). In both cases we further filter by counting the number of carbon atoms in the matching fragment to be roughly in the expected range for a monoterpenoid (usually a fused iridoid core will contain 7–9 carbons). (Of course, there are many edge‐cases and one can imagine even more elaborate “filters”, but this shows one approach to improve the F1‐score.) 

Below is the complete Python code in one block:

"""
Classifies: Iridoid Monoterpenoid
Definition: Iridoid monoterpenoids are generally biosynthesized from isoprene and 
usually have a cyclopentane ring fused to a six‐membered (often O‐heterocycle) ring.
(secoiridoids arise when one bond in the cyclopentane ring is cleaved).
This program attempts to detect the “iridoid core” by using SMARTS queries for a 
cyclopenta[c]pyran motif and, if not found, a cyclopenta “seco” variant.

def is_iridoid_monoterpenoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether the given molecule (SMILES string) is an iridoid monoterpenoid.
    The algorithm uses two SMARTS patterns:
      1. A classical cyclopenta[c]pyran pattern (a fused bicyclic system with a 5‐membered cyclopentane 
         fused to a 6‐membered ring containing an oxygen).
      2. A “secoiridoid” variant that lacks the oxygen (to catch cases where cleavage or modifications 
         have occurred).
    In addition, when a match is found, the number of carbon atoms among the matching atoms is counted 
    to ensure that the fragment corresponds to a “monoterpenoid‐sized” core (roughly 7–9 carbons).
    
    Args:
      smiles (str): The SMILES string of the molecule.
      
    Returns:

------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• We first try to match the classical cyclopenta[c]pyran motif using the SMARTS "C1C2CC(C1)OC2".
• If that fails, we try a second variant ("C1C2CC(C1)C2") that might capture cases where the oxygen
  in the six‐membered ring is missing (a possible secoiridoid variant).
• In both cases we check that the number of carbon atoms in the matching fragment is roughly what one expects
  for a monoterpenoid core (7–9 carbons).
• Finally, if neither query yields an acceptable match, the function returns False with a reason.
  
This is only one possible way to improve the detection; further refinements (e.g. additional filtering based on 
stereochemistry or overall size) may be needed to reach a higher F1‐score.
