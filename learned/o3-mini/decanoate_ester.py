Classifies: Decanoate ester

A decanoate ester is defined as a fatty acid ester resulting from the condensation 
of decanoic (capric) acid with the hydroxy group of an alcohol or phenol.
Decanoic acid has the structure CH3(CH2)8C(=O)OH so that its ester (decanoate) 
acyl fragment is CH3(CH2)8C(=O)O (or its deprotonated form). This classifier 
searches for that exact substructure with additional checks to ensure that the 
terminal methyl group is truly terminal (using [CH3;D1]) and that the ester oxygen 
indeed bridges to an external group (degree â‰¥ 2).

def is_decanoate_ester(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a decanoate ester based on its SMILES string.
    This is done by looking for a terminal decanoate acyl chain substructure.
    
    The substructure (for both protonated and deprotonated forms) is defined as:
      [CH3;D1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O
    or
      [CH3;D1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)[O-]
      
    The [CH3;D1] restricts the alkyl chain to start with a terminal methyl group.
    Also, after a match is found, we verify that the ester oxygen (the last atom in the match)
    is indeed attached to another group (degree>=2) so that we do not match free decanoic acid.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains a decanoate ester moiety as defined, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation or reason for the classification.
