def is_2_enoyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if the molecule defined by the SMILES string is a 2-enoyl-CoA.
    The definition requires that the molecule has:
      1. A CoA moiety. For our purposes we check for a characteristic substructure of CoA.
      2. A thioester functional group where the acyl chain is unsaturated with a double bond between its C2 and C3.
         In an acyl chain, the carbonyl carbon is position 1 so the double bond must occur between the next two carbons.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a 2-enoyl-CoA, otherwise False.
        str: Explanation of the classification result.
