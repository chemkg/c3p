Classifies: Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid
Definition: A type of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid whose structures are built up of two benzylisoquinoline units 
linked by ether bridges. Various structural patterns resulting from additional bridging between the two units 
(by direct Câ€“C linking or by methylenedioxy groups) are common.

def is_bisbenzylisoquinoline_alkaloid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid based on its SMILES string.
    The classification uses two main criteria:
      1. The molecule must contain at least two distinct benzylisoquinoline units.
         We search for the bicyclic fragment representing a tetrahydroisoquinoline unit with an attached aromatic ring.
         A more permissive SMARTS pattern "c1ccc2CCNC2c1" is used to allow for additional substituents and loss
         of explicit stereochemistry.
      2. The two units must be connected by a bridging group. We check for:
         - An aromatic ether bridge (SMARTS: "[c;r]-O-[c;r]"), or
         - A methylenedioxy bridge (SMARTS: "cO[CH2]Oc").
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
