Classifies: 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
Definition: A 1-O-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine having (R)-configuration.
The molecule should have a fatty acyl chain esterified at the sn-1 position,
a phosphoethanolamine head group attached to the glycerol backbone,
and a chiral center (at the sn-2 position) with (R)-configuration.

def is_1_acyl_sn_glycero_3_phosphoethanolamine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine based on its SMILES string.
    The function verifies:
      1. A phosphoethanolamine head group (substructure "COP(O)(=O)OCCN").
      2. An acyl ester group attached at the sn-1 position â€“ identified by a carbonyl ester pattern "C(=O)O[CH2]".
      3. The presence of a glycerol chiral center (from the glycerol backbone) with CIP code "R"
         that connects one branch to the acyl ester (sn-1) and the other branch to the phosphoethanolamine head group (via an oxygen attached to P).
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule.
    Returns:
        (bool, str): Tuple with True and a reason if classified correctly, or False with an error reason.
