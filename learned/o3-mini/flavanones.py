Classifies: Flavanones
Definition: Members of the class of flavans with a 3,4-dihydro-2-aryl-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one skeleton and its substituted derivatives.
Improvement:
  - Uses the known SMARTS pattern for the 2-phenylchroman-4-one (flavanone) core.
  - Specifies useChirality=False in substructure matching.
  - Inspects the match to ensure that the two saturated carbons in the heterocycle remain non-aromatic,
    as required for the dihydro (flavanone) core.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavanone (or a substituted derivative) based on its SMILES string.
    A flavanone must contain the 3,4-dihydro-2-aryl-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one core.
    
    To improve upon a simple substructure match, this function:
      1. Parses the molecule and creates a SMARTS pattern based on the known flavanone core.
         (Pattern: "O=C1CC(c2ccccc2)Oc2ccccc12")
      2. Uses useChirality=False to allow variant stereochemistry.
      3. For every match, checks that the two carbons in the heterocycle (immediately following the carbonyl)
         are not aromatic (as they are sp3 in a true flavanone).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a flavanone; False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the reasoning.
