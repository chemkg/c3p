Classifies: CHEBI:38757 isoflavones

"""
Classifies: Isoflavones â€“ any isoflavonoid with a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one (3-aryl-4H-chromen-4-one) skeleton 
and its substituted derivatives.
The algorithm attempts to match a complete isoflavone skeleton as a substructure.
Two alternatives are allowed:
  1. The fully aromatic isoflavone core.
  2. A dihydroisoflavone core (where the chromenone ring is partially saturated).
Both alternatives require that the external aryl (phenyl) group is attached via a single bond.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an isoflavone 
    (i.e. an isoflavonoid with a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one skeleton or a dihydro derivative)
    based on its SMILES string.
    
    The query uses a combined SMARTS that allows either:
      - The fully aromatic isoflavone core: "c1ccc2c(c1)oc(=O)c(c2)-c3ccccc3"
      - Or its dihydro counterpart: "c1ccc2C(c1)OC(=O)C2-c3ccccc3"
    The "-" connecting the two parts guarantees that the aryl group is linked by a single bond.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as an isoflavone, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
