    """
    Determines if a molecule is an isoflavone 
    (i.e. an isoflavonoid with a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one skeleton)
    based on its SMILES string.

    Our two-part strategy is:
      1. Identify a benzopyran-4-one (chromen-4-one) core.
         Here we use a SMARTS that is a bit more permissive than the previous attempt.
         The pattern "c1coc2c(c1=O)cccc2" should capture the bicyclic core even if substituted.
      2. Identify an attached phenyl (aromatic benzene) that is linked to the core via a non-ring bond.
         The rationale is that an isoflavone has a 3-aryl substituent attached by a single bond 
         (as opposed to being fused into the core). 

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as an isoflavone, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
