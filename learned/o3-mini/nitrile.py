Classifies: nitrile compounds (RC#N)
A nitrile is defined as a compound featuring a carbonâ€“nitrogen triple bond 
where the carbon is substituted (i.e. not simply HC#N). The function disqualifies
nitrile groups that are coordinated to metals (e.g. in salt forms) but accepts any 
substituent (even heteroatoms) as long as it is not merely an implicit hydrogen.

def is_nitrile(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nitrile based on its SMILES string.
    A nitrile should contain at least one triple-bonded C#N group where the carbon is substituted.
    To be considered substituted, the nitrile carbon must have at least one additional explicit neighbor
    (i.e. a bond other than the one to the nitrile nitrogen). Also, if this additional neighbor is a metal,
    the group is not counted, as metals (or ionic compounds) are outside our target organic class.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a nitrile (contains at least one appropriate substituted nitrile group),
              False otherwise.
