Classifies: Beta-lactam
A beta-lactam is defined as a lactam in which the amide bond is contained 
within a four-membered ring. In this context the ring should contain exactly
one nitrogen and three carbons, and one of those carbons (the carbonyl carbon)
must be bonded to a nitrogen (inside the ring) while also bearing an exocyclic
carbonyl (C=O) group. This improved approach is aimed at reducing false positives.

def is_beta_lactam(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a beta-lactam based on its SMILES string.
    
    A beta-lactam must contain a four-membered ring composed exactly of one 
    nitrogen and three carbons. In this ring, at least one of the carbon atoms 
    (the carbonyl carbon) must:
       - be directly bonded to a nitrogen atom (within the ring) and 
       - have an external double bond to an oxygen (i.e. an exocyclic carbonyl group)
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as beta-lactam, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
