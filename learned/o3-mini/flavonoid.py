Classifies: Flavonoid
Definition: A flavonoid is any compound whose skeleton is based on 1‚Äêbenzopyran (chromene)
with an aryl substituent at position 2.
This module uses improved SMARTS patterns that anchor the 2-phenyl substitution using recursive SMARTS 
and allow for extra substituents on the rings.

def is_flavonoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavonoid based on its SMILES string.
    A flavonoid is defined as a compound with a 1-benzopyran (chromene) core having an aryl (phenyl) 
    substituent attached at the C2 position.
    
    Two SMARTS patterns are used:
      1. For the fully aromatic (flavone/flavonol-like) scaffold:
         "c1ccc2c(c1)oc(c2)[$(c3ccccc3)]"
         - This pattern requires a benzopyran core (aromatic ring fused to an oxacycle)
           with a substituent that is recognized recursively as a benzene ring.
      2. For the dihydro (flavanone/flavan-like) scaffold:
         "c1ccc2c(c1)OC(C2)[$(c3ccccc3)]"
         - Similar to the aromatic version, but with the C2 carbon saturated.
         
    The recursive SMARTS syntax "$(...)" ensures that the substituent exactly matches a phenyl group,
    while the rest of the pattern allows other substituents to be present.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a flavonoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
