    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavonoid based on its SMILES string.
    Flavonoids are defined as compounds having a 1-benzopyran skeleton (chromene)
    with an aryl substituent at position 2.
    
    For this purpose two SMARTS patterns are used:
    1. A "flavan" pattern (saturated at C2â€“C3) with the required aryl substituent.
    2. A "flavone" pattern (featuring a carbonyl group at position 4) with the aryl group.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a flavonoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
