Classifies: CHEBI:47909 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid
"""
"""
Classifies: 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid â€“ a 3-oxo steroid with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone)
located on a fused steroid nucleus. The steroid nucleus must be built of a fused system with at least 4 rings,
with a characteristic ring-size distribution (at least one five-membered ring and at least three six-membered rings).

    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid based on its SMILES.
    The molecule must have a steroid nucleus (fused rings with at least one 5-membered and three 6-membered rings)
