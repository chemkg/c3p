    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid based on its SMILES string.
    A 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid is defined by having a steroid nucleus (typically 4 fused rings)
    and an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone motif on one of the rings (i.e., a carbonyl conjugated 
    to a C=C double bond).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule meets the criteria, False otherwise.
        str: A reason for the classification.
