"""
"""
Classifies: biflavonoid
Definition:
  A flavonoid oligomer that is obtained by the oxidative coupling of at least two units of aryl‚Äêsubstituted benzopyran rings
  or its substituted derivatives, resulting in the two ring systems being joined together by a single atom or bond.
  
This approach detects biflavonoids by using two looser SMARTS patterns that look for a benzopyran core:
  - Pattern 1 is a generic aromatic benzopyran (as in many flavones/flavonols)
  - Pattern 2 is a partially saturated benzopyran (as in many flavan/catechin types)
After obtaining substructure matches from both patterns, overlapping matches are merged to ensure that each distinct flavonoid unit is counted only once.
Finally, the connectivity between different flavonoid units is checked to assess proper coupling.
Due to the complexity of flavonoid structures and their many derivatizations, this heuristic may still miss some cases.

def is_biflavonoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a biflavonoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    The algorithm uses two looser SMARTS patterns to detect flavonoid units:
      - An aromatic benzopyran pattern (generic flavonoid core)
      - A semi-saturated benzopyran pattern (flavan/catechin-like core)
    After finding substructure matches, overlapping matches are merged so that each distinct unit is counted only once.
    Finally, connectivity between at least two distinct units is checked by finding at least one bond that links atoms 
    from different units.
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a biflavonoid, False otherwise.
