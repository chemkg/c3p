Classifies: dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid
Definition: Any sesquiterpenoid with a dihydroagarofuran skeleton.

Heuristic:
  1. Look for at least one tetrahydrofuran ring (5-membered ring with 1 oxygen and 4 carbons).
  2. Check if that ring is fused with at least two other rings (i.e. shares at least 2 atoms with each additional ring).
  3. In the fused ring system, roughly 10â€“20 carbons should be present (the true dihydroagarofuran core has 15 carbons).
If these conditions are met then we classify the molecule as a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid.

def is_dihydroagarofuran_sesquiterpenoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    This function uses a heuristic:
      - It searches for a tetrahydrofuran ring (a 5-membered ring with one oxygen and four carbons).
      - It then checks that this ring is fused (sharing at least two atoms) with at least two other rings.
      - It also checks that the union of atoms in the fused ring system has a carbon count roughly 
        consistent with a sesquiterpenoid core (about 15 carbons, here allowed in the 10 to 20 range).
        
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
