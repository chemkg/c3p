"""
Classifies: Fatty Amide
Definition: A monocarboxylic acid amide derived from a fatty acid.
A fatty amide is recognized by an amide bond (C(=O)N) where the acyl (carbonyl) portion is derived from a fatty acid
(i.e. contains a long aliphatic chain of at least 8 carbon atoms) while the amine portion is relatively small (no long aliphatic chain).

    Determines if a molecule is a fatty amide.

    A fatty amide is defined as a monocarboxylic acid amide derived from a fatty acid.
    That means that:
      (1) an amide bond (C(=O)N) is present,
      (2) the acyl (C=O side) must come from a fatty acid and thus has an aliphatic chain of at least 8 carbon atoms (including the carbonyl carbon),
      (3) at least one of the substituents on the amide nitrogen is not fatty (i.e. does not have a long aliphatic chain â€“ here we require all chains off the nitrogen be shorter than 8 carbons).
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
