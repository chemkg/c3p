Classifies: Aldoxime (Oximes of aldehydes RCH=NOH)

An aldoxime is an oxime derivative of an aldehyde,
meaning the oxime group is attached to a carbon that once was an aldehyde.
For an aldehyde, the carbon has exactly one hydrogen (RCH=O goes to RCH=NOH).
This script first searches for the general C=Nâ€“OH pattern,
then verifies that the carbon atom involved has exactly one hydrogen.

    Determines if a molecule is an aldoxime based on its SMILES string.
    An aldoxime is characterized by an oxime group derived from an aldehyde,
