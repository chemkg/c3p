"""
Classifies: N-hydroxy-alpha-amino-acid
Definition: Any amino acid in which at least one hydrogen attached to the amino group is replaced by a hydroxy group.
Examples include N-hydroxy glycine, N-hydroxy-L-lysine, N,N-dihydroxy-L-isoleucine, etc.

    """
    Determines if a molecule (given as a SMILES string) is an N-hydroxy-alpha-amino-acid.
    
    For this classification, the molecule must display an amino acid backbone (an alpha-carbon
    bonded to a carboxylic acid group) and the amino group attached to that alpha carbon must have
    at least one hydroxy (â€“OH) substituent.
