"""
Classifies: 3alpha-hydroxy steroid
Definition: A 3-hydroxy steroid in which the 3-hydroxy substituent is in the alpha-position.
This program uses heuristic substructure and ring analyses to decide if a given SMILES string
represents such a molecule.

def is_3alpha_hydroxy_steroid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3alpha-hydroxy steroid based on its SMILES string.
    Heuristics used:
      1. The molecule must have a steroid nucleus (a fused tetracyclic system and
         roughly 3 six-membered rings and 1 five-membered ring).
      2. It must contain at least one hydroxyl group directly attached to a ring carbon
         that is designated with stereochemistry suggesting an alpha (below the plane) orientation.
         (Here we search for a substructure "[C@@H](O)".)
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a 3alpha-hydroxy steroid, else False.
        str: Reason for classification decision.
