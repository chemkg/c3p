Classifies: polyprenol phosphate 
Definition: A prenol phosphate resulting from the formal condensation of the
terminal allylic hydroxy group of a polyprenol with 1 mol eq. of phosphoric acid.
The algorithm verifies:
  1. The presence of a phosphate (P) atom whose oxygen (via a single bond)
     is attached to an spÂ³ carbon that is allylic (i.e. has a neighboring double bond).
  2. A repeating isoprene-like motif, represented by the SMARTS "C/C=C/CC",
     which is expected for polyprenol chains.

def is_polyprenol_phosphate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polyprenol phosphate based on its SMILES string.
    
    A polyprenol phosphate is defined as a compound derived from a polyprenol
    (a series of isoprene units) whose terminal allylic hydroxyl group has been esterified
    with phosphoric acid. This function first looks for a phosphate group connected via
    an oxygen to a carbon that is allylic (i.e. adjacent to a C=C double bond). Second,
    it searches for an isoprene-like pattern ("C/C=C/CC") as evidence of a polyprenol chain.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a polyprenol phosphate, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
