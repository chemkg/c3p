"""
Classifies: Flavones â€“ compounds containing the 2-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one core.
A flavone is defined as a flavonoid having a 2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one scaffold.
This version uses an improved SMARTS pattern that uses fully aromatic notation and relaxes the match criteria.

def is_flavones(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavone (or a substituted derivative) based on its SMILES string.
    In this implementation, a molecule is classified as a flavone if it contains a fused 2-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one core.
    
    The improved SMARTS pattern used is:
      "c1ccc(cc1)-c2oc(=O)c3ccccc23"
    which encodes:
      - a phenyl ring (c1ccc(cc1))
      - attached via a bond (the dash) to a pyranone ring system (c2oc(=O)c3ccccc23)
    This pattern is designed to capture the core structure even when additional substituents are present.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains the flavone core, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the decision.
