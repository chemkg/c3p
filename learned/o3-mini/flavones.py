Classifies: Flavones â€“ compounds containing the 2-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one core (flavone)
A flavone is defined as a flavonoid having a 2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one scaffold.
This version uses an improved SMARTS pattern that enforces the fused-ring connectivity.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a flavone (or a substituted derivative) based on its SMILES string.
    For a molecule to be classified as a flavone, it must possess the fused 2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one
    core. This improved version uses a SMARTS pattern that more strictly encodes the fused bicyclic (chromen-4-one)
    system with an attached phenyl ring.

        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains the flavone core, False otherwise.
