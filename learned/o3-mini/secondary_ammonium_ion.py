Classifies: secondary ammonium ion
Definition: An organic cation obtained by protonation of any secondary amino compound; major species at pH 7.3.
A protonated secondary amine (R2NH) becomes a secondary ammonium ion (R2NH2+), so we are looking for a nitrogen
with a positive formal charge, exactly two heavy (non-hydrogen) neighbors, and one hydrogen.

def is_secondary_ammonium_ion(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule (provided as a SMILES string) belongs to the class of secondary ammonium ions.
    
    A secondary ammonium ion is assumed to come from protonation of a secondary amine (R2NH)
    so that, upon protonation, the nitrogen becomes R2NH2+ (two organic substituents and one hydrogen, with a +1 charge).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if a secondary ammonium ion is identified, False otherwise.
        str: A reason for the classification decision.
