Classifies: polycyclic arene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon)
A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is defined here as a molecule containing at least 
two aromatic rings that are fused (i.e. share at least one full edge â€“ two or more atoms) 
to form a single connected aromatic substructure. Moreover, the fused system should cover 
a significant fraction (>40%) of the heavy atoms and be largely composed of carbon atoms.

def is_polycyclic_arene(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a polycyclic arene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) based on its SMILES.
    
    The molecule is considered a PAH if:
      1. It contains at least two fully aromatic rings (with 5 or more atoms per ring).
      2. At least two of these rings are sufficiently fused (i.e. they share at least 2 atoms).
      3. The fused aromatic system (the union of atoms in the connected rings) covers 
         a significant fraction (>40%) of all heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms in the molecule.
      4. The fused system is largely composed of carbons (at least 60% of its atoms).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
