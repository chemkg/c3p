Classifies: 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid
Definition: Any 3-oxo steroid that contains a double bond between positions 1 and 2.
We use heuristic substructure analysis with RDKit to search for:
  1. A ketone group (C(=O)) located in a ring.
  2. Evidence that the ring system is fused (an atom in the ring belongs to at least two rings).
  3. At least one adjacent (alpha) carbon to the ketone that is involved in a nonâ€“carbonyl C=C double bond,
     which is our proxy for a Delta(1) double bond in ring A.
Note: This is a heuristic approach and may not capture all edge cases.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid based on its SMILES string.
    Criteria:
      - Contains a ketone (C=O) group in a ring (the 3-oxo group),
      - The ring system is fused (at least one atom in the ring belongs to more than one ring),
      - One of the alpha carbons (adjacent to the ketone carbon) is involved in a non-carbonyl C=C double bond,
        corresponding to a double bond between positions 1 and 2.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is a 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid, False otherwise.
