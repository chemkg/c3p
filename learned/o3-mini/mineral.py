Classifies: minerals
A mineral is normally an inorganic crystalline (or formerly crystalline) substance,
often formed by geological processes. Because properties such as crystallinity or geological history
are not encoded in a SMILES string, this classifier uses structural proxies.
Heuristics used include:
  - Many minerals are ionic compounds that appear as disconnected fragments.
  - Many minerals contain metal atoms or formal charges.
  - Many inorganic minerals either have no carbon or only non-organic carbon skeletons.
We now also check individual fragments: if any fragment has at least 3 carbons and 3 hydrogens (after adding Hâ€™s),
it is taken to be organic, and the overall molecule is not classified as a mineral.
Additionally, very small species (fewer than three atoms) are not classified as minerals.

from rdkit import Chem

def is_mineral(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is likely a mineral based on its SMILES string using
    several heuristic checks.
    
    Heuristics used:
      - If the molecule is very small (fewer than 3 atoms), do not call it a mineral.
      - Disconnected fragments are examined individually. If any fragment qualifies as organic 
        (defined as having at least 3 carbon atoms and 3 hydrogen atoms, considering implicit hydrogens),
        then the molecule is classified as non-mineral (an organic salt) despite ionic disconnection.
      - If no organic fragment is present then:
             * A molecule with more than one fragment is classified as a mineral.
             * In a single fragment, if there is no carbon or if metal(s) or formal charges are present,
               we classify it as mineral.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if classified as a mineral, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the decision.
