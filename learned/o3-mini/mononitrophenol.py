Classifies: mononitrophenol
Definition: A mononitrophenol is defined as a phenol (a benzene ring that bears at least one neutral -OH substituent)
with exactly one nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) directly attached to one of its aromatic carbons.
The molecule is assumed to have a molecular weight below 500 Da.

def is_mononitrophenol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a mononitrophenol based on its SMILES string.

    The molecule must:
      - Parse correctly.
      - Have a relatively low molecular weight (< 500 Da).
      - Contain exactly one nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) in the molecule.
      - Have that nitro group attached directly to an aromatic carbon.
      - Possess a benzene ring (6-membered, aromatic, all-carbons) that bears at least one neutral hydroxyl substituent (-OH)
        (attached by a single bond) on one of its carbons â€“ the same ring which bears the nitro substituent.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a mononitrophenol, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
