Classifies: CHEBI:17478 aldehyde

"""
Classifies: Aldehyde (RC(=O)H)
Definition: A compound in which a carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to exactly one hydrogen atom and one R group.
This function will not consider formaldehyde (H2C=O) or carboxylic acids (where the noncarbonyl substituent is oxygen) as aldehydes.

def is_aldehyde(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldehyde based on its SMILES string.
    For this purpose, an aldehyde is defined as a molecule having a formyl group â€“ a carbonyl (C=O) 
    where the carbon has exactly one hydrogen and exactly one heavy-atom substituent (R group),
    with the heavy substituent being nonoxygen (to avoid acids, esters, etc). 
     
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an aldehyde, False otherwise.
