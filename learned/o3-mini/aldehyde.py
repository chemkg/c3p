"""
Classifies: Aldehyde (RC(=O)H)
Definition: A compound having a formyl group, that is, a carbonyl (C=O) bonded to at least one hydrogen.
In our improved method we require that the carbonyl carbon is terminal â€“ it is bonded to one heavy atom (the R group) 
or none (in the case of formaldehyde) and at least one hydrogen. This helps reduce false positives.

def is_aldehyde(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldehyde based on its SMILES string.
    An (organic) aldehyde normally has a formyl group where the carbonyl carbon (C) is double bonded to oxygen (O)
    and its other (single) bond is to either one R group or, in the case of formaldehyde, no heavy-atom R group.
    Additionally, at least one hydrogen must be attached to that carbon.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an aldehyde, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
