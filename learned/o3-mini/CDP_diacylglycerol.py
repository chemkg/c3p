"""
Classifies: CDP-diacylglycerol
Definition: A CDP-glycerol having unspecified acyl groups (most commonly fatty acyl groups) 
at the 1- and 2-positions.
Heuristic improvements in this implementation:
  1. The molecule must be parsable.
  2. It must contain a cytidine moiety (SMARTS "n1ccc(N)nc1=O").
  3. It must have a diphosphate bridge. Instead of using the loose pattern "[P]-O-[P]",
     we use a more specific pattern "P(=O)(O)[O]-[P](=O)(O)" which ensures correct phosphoryl groups.
  4. It must show evidence for a glycerol attachment from the headgroup. Rather than "OP(OC)",
     we now require a branch containing an "OCC" fragment (as in "-OP(OCC)"), a rough indicator for glycerol.
  5. It must contain at least two acyl ester groups (SMARTS "OC(=O)[#6]"), representing the fatty acyl groups.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a CDP-diacylglycerol based on its SMILES string.
    
    A CDP-diacylglycerol must contain:
      - A cytidine moiety,
      - A diphosphate bridge with the correct phosphoryl pattern,
      - A glycerol attachment (indicated by a branch with an OCC fragment),
      - And at least two acyl ester groups.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a CDP-diacylglycerol, otherwise False.
