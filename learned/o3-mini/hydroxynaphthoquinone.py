Classifies: Hydroxynaphthoquinone
Definition: A naphthoquinone is a naphthalene (fused bicyclic aromatic system) in which at least two 
            C(=O) groups are attached to the ring (the oxygen atoms should lie outside of the core) 
            and a hydroxynaphthoquinone is any such system having at least one hydroxy (-OH) substituent 
            on one of the core carbons.
            
Approach:
  1. Parse the SMILES and add explicit hydrogens so that â€“OH groups are visible.
  2. Use a SMARTS query for a naphthalene core (c1ccc2ccccc2c1).
  3. For each atom in the found naphthalene core, count if it has a double bond to oxygen (carbonyl) 
     where the oxygen atom is not part of the core.
  4. Also, count hydroxy substituents (an oxygen attached to the core that has at least one hydrogen).
  5. Return True if there are at least two such carbonyl functions and at least one hydroxy substitution.
