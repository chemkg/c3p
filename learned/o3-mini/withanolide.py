def is_withanolide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a withanolide based on its SMILES string.
    A withanolide is defined as a steroid lactone having a C28 steroid nucleus and a lactone ring
    formed from a modified side chain, including its substituted derivatives.
    
    The criteria used here are heuristic:
      - The molecule must be valid.
      - It should contain a steroid nucleus. Here we use a generic SMARTS for the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene core.
      - It should contain at least one lactone ring (cyclic ester).
      - The molecule should contain at least 28 carbons.
      - It is expected to have at least 5 rings overall (4 from the steroid nucleus and 1 from the lactone).
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as withanolide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
