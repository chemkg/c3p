def is_thiosugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a thiosugar based on its SMILES string.
    
    The function uses a heuristic approach:
      1. The molecule must contain at least one sulfur atom.
      2. The molecule is searched for a candidate sugar ring (ring of size 5 or 6)
         that has a majority of carbons plus one heteroatom (oxygen or sulfur) and several hydroxyl groups.
      3. If the candidate sugar ring contains a ring heteroatom that is sulfur, this
         suggests the classical thiosugar (a thiopyranose or thiofuranose).
      4. Alternatively, if one of the sugar ring carbons is substituted by an S atom 
         (outside the ring) and the ring carries several -OH groups, we interpret this as a thiosugar derivative.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        (bool, str): Tuple where bool is True if molecule is classified as a thiosugar,
                     and str provides the classification rationale.
        
    If the SMILES cannot be parsed or no suitable features are found, returns (False, reason).
