def is_thiosugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a thiosugar based on its SMILES string using an improved heuristic.
    
    Heuristic approach:
      1. The molecule must contain at least one sulfur atom.
      2. Search for candidate sugar rings: rings of 5 or 6 atoms that are saturated and non-aromatic.
         For any candidate ring:
           - Count the number of exocyclic hydroxyl (-OH) groups (require at least two).
           - Look for the case where a ring heteroatom (normally oxygen in sugars) is replaced by sulfur,
             OR one of the ring carbons has an external sulfur substituent.
      3. If no suitable ring is found, search for acyclic carbohydrate patterns:
         Look for a contiguous aliphatic chain (3â€“6 carbons) that is decorated with at least two -OH groups 
         and a sulfur substituent.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): A SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        (bool, str): True with an explanation if the molecule is classified as a thiosugar;
                     otherwise, False with a reason.
