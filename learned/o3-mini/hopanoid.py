Classifies: CHEBI:51963 hopanoid
"""
"""
Classifies: A hopanoid, defined as a triterpenoid based on a hopane skeleton.
We use the heuristic that a hopanoid should have a fused polycyclic core where at
least 5 rings are interconnected (sharing at least 2 atoms per adjacent ring) and
a sufficient number of carbon atoms (usually around 30 for a triterpenoid).

    Determines if a molecule belongs to the hopanoid class based on its SMILES string.
    A hopanoid is defined as a triterpenoid based on a hopane skeleton â€“ in other words,
    the molecule must have a fused polycyclic core with (at least) five rings that share 
    bonds and a high carbon content.
