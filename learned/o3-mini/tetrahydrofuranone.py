"""
Classifies: tetrahydrofuranone
Definition: Any oxolane (i.e. a 5‚Äêmembered saturated ring with one oxygen and four carbons)
that carries an oxo- substituent (a carbonyl, either as a direct C=O or through an acyl group)
on one of the ring carbons. Additionally, the oxolane ring must be isolated (i.e. not fused with other rings)
to avoid false positives.
