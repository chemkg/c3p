Classifies: steroid sulfate
Definition: A sulfuric ester obtained by the formal condensation of a hydroxy group of any steroid
with sulfuric acid.

A valid steroid sulfate must contain:
  1. A steroid nucleus â€“ approximated here as a fused-ring system of at least 4 rings,
     in which at least 60% of the atoms are carbons.
  2. A sulfate ester group: an oxygen atom that bridges a carbon to a sulfate S (S bonded to at least 3 oxygens).
     We further require that the bridging oxygen is only connected to exactly two atoms (one carbon and one sulfur)
     and that the carbon is either in the nucleus or directly adjacent to an atom in the nucleus.

def is_steroid_sulfate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a steroid sulfate based on its SMILES string.

    Steps:
      1. Parse the SMILES string.
      2. Identify a steroid nucleus based on fused rings:
         - Obtain all rings and build a connectivity graph for rings sharing at least 2 atoms.
         - Look for a connected set of at least 4 rings.
         - In that set, require that at least 60% of the atoms are carbons.
      3. Look for a sulfate ester group:
         - For each oxygen atom that has exactly 2 bonds,
           check that one neighbor is sulfur (atomic number 16) and the other is a carbon (atomic number 6).
         - Verify that the sulfur (candidate sulfate) has at least three oxygen neighbors.
         - Finally, check that the carbon linked via the oxygen is either directly in the steroid nucleus
           or at least one of its neighbors is in the nucleus.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a steroid sulfate, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
