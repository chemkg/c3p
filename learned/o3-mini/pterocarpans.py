def is_pterocarpans(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule belongs to the pterocarpan class based on its SMILES string.
    Pterocarpans are defined as having a benzofurochromene core with a 6a,11a-dihydro skeleton.
    The search is based on identifying a central scaffold that can be represented by the following
    dihydrofuran-fused bicyclic system:
         O1CCc2ccccc2OC1c3ccccc3
    This pattern is a simplified heuristic for a fused dihydrofuran ring (with one saturated carbon)
    bridging two aromatic rings. Many pterocarpan derivatives will have substituents on these rings.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is (likely) a pterocarpan, else False.
        str: Explanation for the classification result.
