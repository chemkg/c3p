Classifies: Anthocyanidin Cation (flavylium‚Äêtype aglycon of anthocyanin cation)
Definition: Any organic cation that is an aglycon of anthocyanin cation; they are oxygenated derivatives of flavylium (2-phenylchromenylium).
This heuristic function checks for a positively charged oxygen within a six-membered (pyran) ring that is fused to at least one other aromatic ring,
and an aromatic (phenyl) substituent attached to one of the ring carbons.

def is_anthocyanidin_cation(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an anthocyanidin cation (flavylium-type aglycon) based on its SMILES string.
    
    Heuristic criteria:
      1. The molecule must be valid.
      2. The overall molecule must carry positive charge(s).
      3. There must be at least one aromatic oxygen with formal charge +1.
      4. This oxygen should lie within a six-membered aromatic ring (the pyran ring of the flavylium core).
      5. The ring containing the [O+ ] should be fused to at least one other aromatic ring.
      6. At least one carbon of the candidate ring should have a substituent that is an aromatic ring (a phenyl group)
         representing the 2-phenyl substitution expected in a 2-phenylchromenylium core.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as an anthocyanidin cation, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
