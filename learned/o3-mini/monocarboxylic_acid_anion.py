Classifies: Monocarboxylic acid anion
Definition: A carboxylic acid anion formed when the carboxy group of a monocarboxylic acid is deprotonated.
A genuine monocarboxylic acid anion should contain exactly one deprotonated carboxylate group ([O-]C(=O)â€“R)
and the overall molecule should have a net formal charge of -1. In addition, the molecule should be a single fragment,
and it should not contain any positively charged atoms that would hint at internal salt formation.

def is_monocarboxylic_acid_anion(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a monocarboxylic acid anion based on its SMILES string.
    The requirements are:
      - The molecule must be parsed successfully.
      - The molecule should be a single fragment (i.e. not include counterions).
      - None of the atoms should carry a positive formal charge.
      - The molecule should have a net formal charge of -1.
      - There must be exactly one deprotonated carboxylate group present.
        The carboxylate group is defined as an oxygen with a -1 charge directly bonded to a carbon,
        where that carbon is double-bonded to another oxygen.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a monocarboxylic acid anion, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
