"""
Classifies: Aldopentose
Definition: A pentose (5-carbon sugar) with a (potential) aldehyde group at one end.
This function checks if the input SMILES corresponds to an aldopentose.
It looks for:
 - Exactly 5 carbons,
 - An explicit aldehyde group OR a characteristic cyclic hemiacetal ring (furanose or pyranose),
 - A sufficient number of hydroxyl groups.
Examples provided include various cyclic forms as well as open-chain (aldehydo) forms.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aldopentose based on its SMILES string.
    
    An aldopentose has 5 carbon atoms and an aldehyde group at one end (either explicitly or present as a 
    hemiacetal center in cyclic forms). Typical examples are xylose, arabinose, ribose etc.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an aldopentose, False otherwise.
