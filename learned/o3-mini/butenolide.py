Classifies: Butenolide
Definition: A gamma-lactone that consists of a 2-furanone skeleton and its substituted derivatives.
A butenolide is a five-membered lactone ring in which:
  - Exactly one of the five ring atoms is an oxygen (the lactone oxygen).
  - One ring carbon carries an exocyclic carbonyl group (i.e. a double bond to an oxygen that is not part of the ring).
  - At least one ring bond is unsaturated (i.e. a C=C double bond present inside the ring).
This implementation analyzes the ring information instead of relying solely on a fixed SMARTS pattern.
It should correct some of the false positives (molecules with similar substructures but not true butenolides)
and false negatives (true butenolides that do not exactly match the canonical SMARTS) from the previous version.

def is_butenolide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a butenolide (gamma-lactone with a 2-furanone skeleton)
    based on its SMILES string.
    
    Strategy:
      1. Parse the molecule.
      2. Iterate through all rings of size 5.
         - The ring must have exactly one oxygen atom (the lactone oxygen).
         - One of the ring carbons must be attached (outside the ring) to an oxygen via a double bond (the carbonyl).
         - There must be at least one double bond within the ring (indicating unsaturation).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule appears to be a butenolide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
