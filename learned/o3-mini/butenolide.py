    """
    Determines if a molecule is a butenolide based on its SMILES string.
    A butenolide is defined as a gamma-lactone that consists of a 2-furanone skeleton
    (i.e. a five-membered cyclic ester ring with one ring oxygen, a carbonyl group, 
    and an internal double bond) and its substituted derivatives.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule appears to be a butenolide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
