"""
Classifies: Alkanethiol
An alkanethiol is defined as a compound in which a sulfanyl group (-SH) 
is attached to an alkyl group (i.e., the sulfur is bonded to at least one carbon).
Examples include ethanethiol (CCS), 1-hexanethiol (SCCCCCC), and many others.

def is_alkanethiol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines whether a molecule is an alkanethiol by checking if it contains
    a thiol functional group (-SH) attached to a carbon atom.
    
    The approach is to:
      - Parse the SMILES string.
      - Add explicit hydrogens (this ensures that the â€“SH is correctly represented).
      - Search for a substructure matching the SMARTS pattern "[#16;X2&H1]-[C]".

        smiles (str): SMILES string representing the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains a valid alkanethiol group, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
