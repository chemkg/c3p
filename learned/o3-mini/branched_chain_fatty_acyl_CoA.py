Classifies: branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA
Definition: A fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group 
of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of any branched-chain fatty acid.
The improved algorithm:
  1. Checks for presence of a CoA moiety (via an adenine-derived substructure).
  2. Checks for a thioester bond linking the fatty acyl chain to CoA.
  3. Starting from the carbonylâ€™s fatty acyl neighbor (i.e. not the S partner),
     it traverses only carbon atoms (excluding the carbonyl) to collect the acyl chain.
  4. Requires that the chain is long enough and that at least one carbon shows branching 
     (i.e. it has more than two carbon neighbors within the chain).

def is_branched_chain_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    The improved algorithm:
      1. Parses the SMILES.
      2. Requires an adenine substructure from CoA.
      3. Requires a thioester bond [CX3](=O)[SX2] linking the fatty acyl chain.
      4. From each thioester, identifies the fatty acyl branch (obtained from the carbonyl atom's neighbor
         that is not the sulfur) and performs a DFS (restricted to carbon atoms and not going back to the carbonyl)
         to capture the fatty acyl chain.
      5. Checks that the chain is long (at least 3 atoms) and that at least one carbon in the chain has more than 
         2 neighbors (within the chain) indicating branching.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
