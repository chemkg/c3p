Classifies: branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA
Definition: A fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group 
of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of any branched-chain fatty acid.
The improved algorithm:
  1. Checks for a CoA marker (via an adenine-derived substructure).
  2. Locates a thioester linkage [CX3](=O)[SX2].
  3. From the thioester carbonyl, it identifies the fatty acyl neighbor (the atom not linked to S and not oxygen)
     and then collects the contiguous set of carbon atoms (via DFS) that are not part of CoA, the carbonyl, or the sulfur.
  4. The obtained acyl chain must be at least 3 carbons long and at least one carbon in that set must have at least 3 neighbors 
     (counting only neighbors in the chain) to indicate branching.

def is_branched_chain_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.

    The improved algorithm:
      1. Parses the molecule.
      2. Checks for the presence of a CoA moiety (by matching an adenine substructure).
      3. Finds a thioester bond ([CX3](=O)[SX2]) bridging the fatty acyl chain with the CoA.
      4. For each thioester match, identifies the fatty acyl's starting atomâ€”the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl
         (which is not the sulfur and not an oxygen).
      5. Using a depth-first search (DFS), collects all connected carbon atoms (atomic number 6) that belong to
         the acyl chain while forbidding reentry into the carbonyl, the sulfur, or any atoms already in the CoA moiety.
      6. If the resulting set has at least 3 carbon atoms and if any carbon in that subset has three or more neighbors
         (when only neighbors in the subset are counted), then a branch is present.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is identified as a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
