Classifies: CHEBI:68472 pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside
"""
"""
Classifies: A deoxyribonucleoside containing a pyrimidine base.
A pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside contains a five‚Äêmembered deoxyribose sugar (a furanose ring missing the 2'-OH) 
that is linked via a glycosidic bond to a pyrimidine base.

def is_pyrimidine_deoxyribonucleoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside.
    The method uses a heuristic based on:
      - detecting a pyrimidine base via a generic SMARTS "c1cncnc1"
      - detecting a five-membered sugar ring (furanose) that contains exactly one ring oxygen and 
        exactly 2 exocyclic oxygen atoms attached to ring carbon atoms [indicative of a deoxyribose sugar].
      - confirming that one atom from the sugar ring is directly connected to an atom in the pyrimidine base.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
