Classifies: Phospho sugars

def is_phospho_sugar(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a phospho sugar based on its SMILES string.
    Definition (in this implementation):
      - The molecule contains a sugar ring, defined as a 5- or 6-membered ring with exactly one oxygen atom.
      - The molecule contains a phosphate ester group. This is detected by finding a phosphorus atom
        that has at least one double-bonded oxygen (indicating a P=O) and that is connected via an oxygen 
        (the ester oxygen) to either the ring directly or to a substituent attached to a ring atom.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a phospho sugar, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
