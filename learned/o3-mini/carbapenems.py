Classifies: Carbapenems â€“ beta-lactam antibiotics with a carbapenem skeleton substituted at positions 3, 4, and 6.
This heuristic implementation detects a four-membered beta-lactam ring (containing one nitrogen and a carbonyl)

    Determines if a molecule is a carbapenem based on its SMILES string.
