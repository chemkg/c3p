Classifies: Carbapenems â€“ beta-lactam antibiotics with a carbapenem skeleton substituted at positions 3, 4, and 6.
This improved heuristic implementation detects a four-membered beta-lactam ring (with one nitrogen and at least one carbonyl group)
fused with a five-membered ring that (a) does not contain sulfur and (b) includes at least one carbon-carbon double bond,
a characteristic of the unsaturated five-membered ring in many carbapenem antibiotics.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a carbapenem based on its SMILES string.
    This heuristic implementation works as follows:
      1. Parse the SMILES and get ring information.
      2. Look for candidate 4-membered rings (potential beta-lactam rings) that have:
            - Exactly 4 atoms.
            - Exactly one nitrogen atom.
            - At least one carbon with a double-bonded oxygen (i.e. a carbonyl).
      3. For each candidate 4-membered ring, look for a fused 5-membered ring that:
            - Shares at least 2 atoms with the 4-membered ring.
            - Does not contain any sulfur.
            - Contains at least one carbon-carbon double bond inside the ring.
      4. If such a fused bicyclic system is found, classify the molecule as a carbapenem.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as a carbapenem, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
