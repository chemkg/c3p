def is_trans_2_enoyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a trans-2-enoyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.

    To be classified as trans-2-enoyl-CoA, the molecule must have:
      1. A recognizable Coenzyme A moiety: we look for the adenine fragment of adenosine.
      2. A thioester group, i.e. a carbonyl connected to a sulfur atom.
         (Note: we require the sulfur to be divalent: [CX3](=O)[S;X2])
      3. An acyl chain that is alpha,beta-unsaturated at the thioester junction:
         that is, the carbonyl carbonâ€™s alpha carbon should be double-bonded 
         (with trans stereochemistry) to a beta carbon.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as trans-2-enoyl-CoA, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification outcome.
