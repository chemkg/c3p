"""
Classifies: Phenyl acetates
Definition: An acetate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of acetic acid 
with the hydroxy group of any phenol.
Improvement strategy:
  1. Use a SMARTS pattern that exactly requires the acetate ester part as CH3C(=O)â€“.
  2. Check that the oxygen is directly attached to an aromatic carbon that belongs to at least one
     six-membered ring that is an isolated benzene ring: all atoms in that ring are aromatic 
     carbons and none of the ring atoms is shared with any other ring.
  3. Reject molecules that are likely too complex (here, with molecular weight >350 Da) to be 
     considered simple phenyl acetates.

def is_phenyl_acetates(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a phenyl acetate based on its SMILES string.
    A phenyl acetate is defined as an acetate ester (CH3C(=O)-O-) where the ester oxygen is attached
    directly to an aromatic carbon, and that aromatic carbon must belong to an isolated six-membered
    benzene ring (i.e. no fusion with other rings). Additionally, the overall molecular weight must be
    in the range for a relatively simple phenyl acetate (<=350 Da).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a simple phenyl acetate, False otherwise.
