Classifies: CHEBI:83970 cardiac glycoside

"""
Classifies: Cardiac glycoside (Steroid lactones containing sugar residues that act on the contractile force of the cardiac muscles)
This heuristic approach searches for:
  1. A basic steroid nucleus (four fused rings typical of steroids).
  2. A lactone moiety (here a furanone ring pattern).
  3. At least one sugar residue (pyranose or furanose ring motif).

Note: The SMARTS patterns used are approximate and may not capture every variant.

def is_cardiac_glycoside(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a cardiac glycoside based on its SMILES string.
    Cardiac glycosides are defined as steroid lactones containing sugar residues.
    
    Heuristic criteria:
      - Steroid nucleus: a tetracyclic fused ring system.
      - Lactone ring: a five‚Äêmembered ring containing a carbonyl and an oxygen (butenolide).
      - Sugar residue: at least one sugar ring (pyranose or furanose pattern).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule qualifies as a cardiac glycoside, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
