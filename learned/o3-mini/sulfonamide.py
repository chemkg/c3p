"""
Classifies: Sulfonamide
Definition: An amide of a sulfonic acid, RS(=O)(=O)NR'2.
This module checks if a molecule contains a valid sulfonamide group.
The approach is to first flag candidate S(=O)(=O)-N motifs using a SMARTS pattern,
then for each candidate verify that:
  1. The sulfur atom has exactly two double bonds to oxygen.
  2. It has exactly one bond to a nitrogen.
  3. It has exactly one additional substituent (typically R) so that its total degree is 4.
If a candidate passes those checks we classify the molecule as a sulfonamide.

def is_sulfonamide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a sulfonamide based on its SMILES string.
    A sulfonamide is defined as RS(=O)(=O)NR'2.
    
    The algorithm first uses a SMARTS pattern to pick up any potential S(=O)(=O)-N
    connectivity. Then for each candidate it inspects the sulfur atomâ€™s bonds to
    ensure that it has exactly two double bonds to oxygen, one bond to a nitrogen,
    and a fourth bond to an R group.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a sulfonamide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
