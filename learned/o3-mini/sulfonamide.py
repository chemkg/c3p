"""
Classifies: Sulfonamide
Definition: An amide of a sulfonic acid, RS(=O)2NR'2.
This module checks if a molecule contains a valid sulfonamide group.
The approach is to first flag a candidate S(=O)(=O)-N motif via SMARTS,
then verify that the sulfur atom has exactly two double-bonded oxygens,
and an overall connectivity consistent with a sulfonamide:
  â€¢ The sulfur normally has four bonds: one to R, two double bonds to O, 
    and one single bond to N.
This should help reduce false positives (where the moiety is embedded elsewhere)
and false negatives.

def is_sulfonamide(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a sulfonamide based on its SMILES string.
    A sulfonamide is defined as RS(=O)(=O)NR'2.
    
    The algorithm first finds a candidate group using a SMARTS pattern that matches a 
    sulfur atom double-bonded to two oxygens and singly bonded to a nitrogen.
    It then checks that the sulfur atom has exactly two double bonds to oxygen and 
    an overall degree consistent with an RS(=O)(=O)NR'2 moiety.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a sulfonamide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
