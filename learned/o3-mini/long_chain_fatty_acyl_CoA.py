def is_long_chain_fatty_acyl_CoA(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA based on its SMILES string.
    
    The algorithm checks for:
      1. A CoA moiety by detecting a characteristic pantetheine fragment.
      2. A thioester linkage group ([CX3](=O)[SX2]) connecting the fatty acyl chain to CoA.
      3. A fatty acyl chain (starting from the carbonyl carbon) that contains between 13 and 22 carbon atoms.
      
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, False otherwise.
