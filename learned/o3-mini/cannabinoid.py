Classifies: Cannabinoid
Cannabinoids are a diverse group of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites 
that occur in the Cannabis plant and are also produced endogenously in humans and animals.
They are characterized by the presence of oxygen â€“ either as part of a heterocyclic ring,
or in the form of various functional groups such as aromatic hydroxyls or ethanolamine/glycerol substructures.
This heuristic approach checks for one or more of these features.

def is_cannabinoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a cannabinoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    This heuristic algorithm requires that:
      1. The SMILES can be parsed.
      2. The molecule has at least one oxygen atom.
      3. The molecule displays at least one cannabinoid-like motif:
           - A ring containing an oxygen (as in benzopyran or related heterocycles),
           - OR an aromatic hydroxyl group (as in resorcinol moieties),
           - OR an ethanolamine/glycerol fragment (observed in endocannabinoids).
      4. The molecular weight is not unrealistically low (here we expect >200 Da).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is likely a cannabinoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
