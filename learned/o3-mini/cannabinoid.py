Classifies: Cannabinoid
Cannabinoids are a diverse group of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites 
that occur in the Cannabis plant and are also produced endogenously in humans and animals.
They are characterized by oxygen in the form of a heterocyclic ring (often fused),
or as aromatic hydroxyl groups (often in a resorcinol-like motif),
or as part of an ethanolamide (or glycerol) fragment found in endocannabinoids.
This heuristic algorithm uses several additional filters (molecular weight range,
limiting excessive amide bonds, and requiring a long alkyl chain in one motif)
to reduce false positives.

def is_cannabinoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a cannabinoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    This algorithm checks that:
      1. The SMILES is valid.
      2. The molecular weight is within a plausible range (200 - 900 Da).
      3. The molecule contains oxygen.
      4. It does NOT have excessive amide bonds (if it has â‰¥2 amide bonds we assume a peptide fragment).
      5. It displays at least one cannabinoid-like motif:
           a. A resorcinol motif (benzene with two hydroxyls) attached to a long alkyl chain,
           b. OR an ethanolamide/ acylamide fragment with a long aliphatic chain,
           c. OR a fused ring system with at least one oxygen in one of the rings.
           
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is likely a cannabinoid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
