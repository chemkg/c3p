"""
Classifies: 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine
Definition:
  A 3-sn-glycerophosphoserine compound having acyl substituents at the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions.
  That is, a glycerol backbone with three â€“OH groups where the sn-3 hydroxyl is phosphorylated and then
  esterified with L-serine, and the sn-1 and sn-2 hydroxyls are esterified with acyl chains.
  
This program uses RDKit to check that the given SMILES string has a phosphoserine head group 
and at least two acyl ester substituents.

def is_3_sn_phosphatidyl_L_serine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine based on its SMILES string.
    It verifies that the molecule contains:
      - A phosphoserine head group (a phosphate ester of L-serine attached via a glycerol fragment)
      - Two acyl ester substituents (as fatty acyl chains of at least 4 carbons) attached to positions sn-1 and sn-2.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine, False otherwise.
