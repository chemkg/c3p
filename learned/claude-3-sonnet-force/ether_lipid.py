"""
Classifies: CHEBI:64611 ether lipid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify ether lipids based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of at least one ether oxygen (-O-)
2. Absence of any ester groups (-O-C(=O)-)
3. Presence of long alkyl chains (>= 8 carbons)
4. Molecular weight >= 300 Da

However, based on the provided outcomes, it seems that this approach has some limitations and fails to correctly classify many ether lipid structures.

Potential issues and improvements:

1. **Linkage Pattern**: The program only checks for the presence of ether oxygens and absence of ester groups. However, ether lipids can have a more complex linkage pattern involving both ether and ester linkages. For example, some of the false negatives contain both ether and ester linkages, which should be allowed for ether lipids.

   **Improvement**: Instead of strictly checking for the absence of esters, the program should allow for both ether and ester linkages but ensure that at least one ether linkage is present.

2. **Glycerol Backbone**: The program does not explicitly check for the presence of a glycerol backbone, which is a common structural feature of many ether lipids.

   **Improvement**: Add a check for a glycerol backbone pattern, similar to how it is done for triglycerides or other glycerolipids.

3. **Alkyl Chain Length**: The program checks for the presence of alkyl chains with a minimum length of 8 carbons. However, some of the false negatives have shorter chains, which may still be valid for ether lipids.

   **Improvement**: Relax the minimum chain length requirement or consider checking for the total number of carbons instead of individual chain lengths.

4. **Molecular Weight**: While the molecular weight check can be useful, it may not be a strict requirement for all ether lipids, especially smaller or more compact structures.

   **Improvement**: Consider removing the molecular weight check or adjusting the threshold based on further analysis of the false negatives.

5. **Additional Structural Features**: Some of the false negatives may have additional structural features or substituents that are not accounted for in the current program.

   **Improvement**: Analyze the false negatives and identify any common structural patterns or substituents that should be considered for ether lipid classification.

6. **Outliers and Exceptions**: It is possible that some of the false negatives are misclassified in the benchmark data or represent edge cases or exceptions to the general definition of ether lipids.

   **Improvement**: If there is a strong justification for considering certain structures as ether lipids despite not meeting the program's criteria, consider adding exceptions or more flexible rules to accommodate them.

Overall, the program's approach of using SMARTS patterns and substructure matching is a good starting point, but it may require more sophisticated rules and a more comprehensive analysis of the structural diversity within the ether lipid class to improve its performance.
