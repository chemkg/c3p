"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18303 phosphatidyl-L-serine
"""
The previous program had a reasonable approach to identifying phosphatidyl-L-serine molecules, but it appears to have some issues that led to the poor performance.

Potential issues:

1. **Phosphatidyl group pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the phosphatidyl group (`P(OCC(OC(=O))OC(=O))`) may be too specific or not capturing all possible variations of the phosphatidyl group. Phosphatidyl-L-serine molecules can have different substituents or arrangements around the phosphate group.

2. **Serine residue pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the serine residue (`C(N)C(O)=O`) may be too specific or not capturing all possible variations of the serine residue. The serine residue can have different protonation states or modifications.

3. **Ester linkage check**: The check for the ester linkage between the phosphatidyl group and the serine residue (`OC(=O)C`) may be too strict or not accounting for all possible arrangements of the ester bond.

4. **Fatty acid chain pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify fatty acid chains (`[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]`) may be too specific or not capturing all possible variations of fatty acid chains. Fatty acid chains can have different lengths, degrees of unsaturation, and branching patterns.

5. **Molecular weight check**: The molecular weight check (`mol_wt < 600`) may be too strict or not accounting for all possible variations of phosphatidyl-L-serine molecules. Depending on the fatty acid chain lengths and substituents, the molecular weight can vary significantly.

To improve the program, you could try the following:

1. **Refine the SMARTS patterns**: Analyze the false positives and false negatives to identify patterns that are not being correctly captured by the current SMARTS patterns. Update the patterns or use more general patterns that can capture a wider range of variations.

2. **Consider alternative approaches**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, you could explore alternative approaches such as fingerprint-based similarity calculations or machine learning models trained on a diverse set of phosphatidyl-L-serine molecules.

3. **Analyze structural features**: Investigate other structural features that could help distinguish phosphatidyl-L-serine molecules, such as atom counts, charge distributions, or specific functional group arrangements.

4. **Adjust thresholds and parameters**: Experiment with different thresholds and parameters (e.g., molecular weight range, number of rotatable bonds) to find the optimal values for your dataset.

5. **Handle exceptions and edge cases**: Identify and handle exceptions or edge cases that may not be covered by the general rules or patterns.

6. **Incorporate additional validation steps**: Consider adding additional validation steps or checks to increase the confidence in the classification, such as checking for specific atom environments or substructures.

It's also important to note that some of the false positives or false negatives could be due to errors or inconsistencies in the benchmark data itself. If you have a strong understanding of the chemical class and the classifications seem reasonable based on your knowledge, you can choose to adjust the program accordingly and provide justification for your decisions.
