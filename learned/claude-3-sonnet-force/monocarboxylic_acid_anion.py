"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35757 monocarboxylic acid anion
"""
The previous program attempted to classify monocarboxylic acid anions by checking for the presence of a single carboxylate anion (-COO-) group and ensuring that there is only one carbonyl oxygen in the molecule. However, based on the outcomes, there are some issues with this approach:

1. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classified some molecules as monocarboxylic acid anions, even though they contained additional functional groups like amines or zwitterionic structures. Examples include sarcosinate, L-alanine zwitterion, and diclofenac potassium.

2. **False negatives**: The program missed several valid monocarboxylic acid anions, mainly due to the presence of additional carbonyl oxygens in the molecule. Examples include prostaglandins, steroids, and fatty acids with additional hydroxy or oxo groups.

To improve the classification, we need to address these issues and refine the criteria for identifying monocarboxylic acid anions.

Proposed changes:

1. **Exclude zwitterionic structures**: Zwitterionic structures contain both positively and negatively charged groups, which should be excluded from the monocarboxylic acid anion class. We can check for the presence of positively charged atoms (e.g., N+) and exclude such molecules.

2. **Allow additional carbonyl oxygens**: Some monocarboxylic acid anions may have additional carbonyl oxygens, such as those in prostaglandins, steroids, and fatty acids with hydroxy or oxo groups. Instead of strictly checking for a single carbonyl oxygen, we can allow additional carbonyl oxygens, but ensure that there is only one carboxylate anion group.

3. **Consider additional structural features**: While the current program focuses solely on the carboxylate anion group, we could potentially incorporate additional structural features to improve the classification accuracy. For example, we could check for common structural motifs found in monocarboxylic acid anions, such as long alkyl chains or cyclic structures.

4. **Use a more comprehensive set of examples**: The current set of examples may not cover all possible cases of monocarboxylic acid anions. It would be beneficial to gather a more comprehensive and diverse set of examples to improve the robustness of the classification algorithm.

It's important to note that while these proposed changes may improve the classification accuracy, there may still be some edge cases or systematic errors in the benchmark data. In such cases, it's essential to use your chemical knowledge and judgment to evaluate the classifications and potentially override the benchmark if necessary.
