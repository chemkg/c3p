"""
Classifies: CHEBI:17478 aldehyde
"""
Upon analyzing the previous code and the provided outcomes, it appears that the program has some limitations in accurately identifying aldehyde groups. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **False Negatives**: The program seems to be missing some valid aldehyde groups, as indicated by the false negatives. This could be due to the following reasons:

   - The program is only considering carbonyl groups (C=O) and checking if they meet the aldehyde criteria. However, some molecules may have the aldehyde group represented differently in their SMILES strings, such as using the "[H]" symbol for the hydrogen atom or different bond representations like "/" or "\\".
   - The program is not considering the possibility of branched or cyclic aldehydes, where the carbonyl carbon may have more than one non-hydrogen neighbor.

2. **False Positives**: The program incorrectly classified N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 as an aldehyde, which is a false positive. This could be because the program does not consider the overall context of the molecule and simply checks for the presence of a carbonyl group with one hydrogen neighbor.

To improve the program, here are some potential modifications:

1. **Enhance SMILES Parsing**: Instead of relying solely on the "C(=O)" SMARTS pattern, consider using more flexible SMARTS patterns or regular expressions to identify aldehyde groups in different representations. This could include patterns like "[H]C=O", "[H]\\C=O", and "[H]/C=O".

2. **Consider Molecular Context**: Introduce additional checks to ensure that the identified carbonyl group is indeed part of an aldehyde functional group within the overall molecular structure. For example, you could check if the carbonyl carbon is part of a ring system or if it is connected to other functional groups, which would disqualify it as an aldehyde.

3. **Handle Branched and Cyclic Aldehydes**: Modify the `is_valid_aldehyde_group` function to allow for more than one non-hydrogen neighbor for the carbonyl carbon. This would enable the program to correctly identify branched and cyclic aldehydes.

4. **Incorporate Additional Validation Rules**: Introduce additional validation rules based on the chemical properties and structural features of aldehydes. For example, you could check the molecular weight, the number of certain elements (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon), or the presence of specific substructures or functional groups that are incompatible with aldehydes.

5. **Improve Reasoning and Feedback**: Provide more detailed reasoning and feedback in the return message, especially for false negatives and false positives. This could include information about the specific substructures or patterns that led to the classification decision.

It's important to note that developing a robust and accurate chemical classification program is a challenging task, and there may be edge cases or exceptions that require additional consideration. Iterative refinement and testing with a diverse set of examples are crucial for improving the program's performance.
