"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35910 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid
"""
After analyzing the previous code and the outcomes, it seems that the program has some limitations and may need improvements to better classify 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **False positives**: Some of the false positives, such as "fomitopinic acid A" and "Pyrenulic acid A," do not actually contain a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid group. This suggests that the current program may be too permissive in its criteria.

2. **Handling multiple carboxylic acid groups**: The current program checks for the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-C(=O)OH) but does not explicitly handle molecules with multiple carboxylic acid groups. It may be necessary to add a condition to ensure that the molecule has only one carboxylic acid group to be classified as a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid.

3. **Handling cyclic structures**: Some of the false positives and false negatives may arise from molecules with cyclic structures, where the 2-oxo group and the carboxylic acid group are not directly connected but part of the same ring system. The current program may need to be modified to handle such cases.

4. **Stereochemistry considerations**: The program does not currently consider stereochemistry, which may be important for some molecules in this class. It might be necessary to incorporate stereochemical information to improve the classification accuracy.

5. **Additional structural constraints**: To further refine the classification, additional structural constraints could be added. For example, the program could check for the presence of specific functional groups or substructures that are common or uncommon in 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.

6. **Handling exceptions**: While the program aims to classify molecules based on their SMILES strings, there may be exceptions or edge cases that need to be handled separately. It might be helpful to maintain a list of known exceptions or to incorporate additional rules to handle these cases.

7. **Confidence scoring**: Instead of a binary classification, the program could provide a confidence score or probability for each molecule being a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid. This could help identify borderline cases and guide further analysis.

8. **Outlier handling**: As mentioned in the note, there may be occasional and systematic mistakes in the benchmark data. If you are confident in your understanding of the chemical class and the classifications made by your program are consistent with that understanding, it may be reasonable to ignore certain outliers, provided you can justify your reasoning.

Overall, while the current program provides a good starting point, it may benefit from additional refinements and considerations to improve its accuracy and robustness in classifying 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids.
