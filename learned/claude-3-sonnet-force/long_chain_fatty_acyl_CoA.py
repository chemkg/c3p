"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33184 long-chain fatty acyl-CoA
"""
Upon analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it appears that the program is failing to correctly classify some examples of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules. Here are some potential reasons and improvements:

1. **Missing double bond patterns**: The program only looks for a single carbon chain pattern with a terminal carbonyl group. However, some examples, such as `cis-tetradec-11-enoyl-CoA` and `(11Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-CoA`, contain double bonds within the fatty acyl chain. The program should account for these double bond patterns.

2. **Missing hydroxyl and keto groups**: Some examples, like `(3R,13Z)-3-hydroxydocosenoyl-CoA` and `(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosapentaenoyl-CoA`, contain hydroxyl or keto groups within the fatty acyl chain. The program should allow for these substituents.

3. **Rigid SMARTS patterns**: The SMARTS pattern used to match the fatty acyl chain (`CCC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCC`) is quite rigid and may not account for variations in the chain length or substituents. A more flexible pattern or multiple patterns may be needed.

4. **Handling stereochemistry**: Some examples, like `(R)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA`, contain stereochemical information. The program should either handle or ignore this information appropriately.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. **Use more flexible SMARTS patterns**: Instead of a single rigid pattern, use multiple SMARTS patterns or more flexible patterns that allow for double bonds, hydroxyl groups, keto groups, and varying chain lengths.

2. **Ignore stereochemistry**: Unless stereochemistry is essential for the classification, you could consider ignoring stereochemical information by removing or ignoring it from the SMILES strings.

3. **Adjust carbon count and rotatable bond thresholds**: The thresholds for the number of carbons (13-22) and the minimum number of rotatable bonds (10) may need to be adjusted based on the examples and the definition of the chemical class.

4. **Use substructure matching with explicit bonds**: Instead of SMARTS patterns, you could use explicit substructure matching with bond types (single, double, triple) to identify the fatty acyl chain and its substituents.

5. **Incorporate additional checks**: If necessary, you could incorporate additional checks for specific patterns or substituents that are not covered by the general SMARTS patterns or substructure matching.

By making these improvements, the program should be better equipped to handle the diverse set of examples provided and correctly classify long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules.
