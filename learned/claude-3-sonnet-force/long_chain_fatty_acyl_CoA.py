"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33184 long-chain fatty acyl-CoA
"""
The previous program attempted to classify long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules based on the presence of a CoA backbone and a fatty acyl chain with a specific length range (C13 to C22). However, the outcomes suggest that the program failed to correctly classify any of the provided examples.

Here are a few potential reasons for the poor performance and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Overly Strict Pattern Matching**: The program relies on pattern matching for the CoA backbone and various substructures of the fatty acyl chain. This approach may be too rigid and fail to account for variations in the input SMILES strings. For example, the CoA backbone pattern may not match due to different stereochemistry or bond order specifications.

2. **Incomplete Fatty Acyl Chain Patterns**: The program uses a set of predefined SMARTS patterns to identify different substructures within the fatty acyl chain. However, this set of patterns may not be comprehensive enough to cover all possible variations encountered in the examples.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions about Chain Length**: The program assumes that the fatty acyl chain should have between 13 and 22 carbon atoms. However, some of the false negatives in the outcomes seem to have shorter or longer chains, suggesting that this assumption may be incorrect or too strict.

4. **Ignoring Stereochemistry**: The program does not appear to consider stereochemistry when analyzing the input molecules. Some of the false negatives in the outcomes contain stereochemical information, which may be important for correctly identifying long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

To improve the program, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Leverage Substructure Searching**: Instead of relying on rigid pattern matching, you could use the RDKit's substructure searching capabilities to identify the presence of the CoA backbone and the fatty acyl chain more flexibly.

2. **Learn from Examples**: Carefully analyze the false negatives and true positives to identify common structural features or patterns that can be used to improve the classification logic.

3. **Refine Chain Length Criteria**: Reevaluate the assumption about the chain length range for long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules based on the provided examples and adjust the criteria accordingly.

4. **Consider Stereochemistry**: Incorporate stereochemical information into the classification logic if it is relevant for correctly identifying long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules.

5. **Utilize Molecular Descriptors**: In addition to structural patterns, consider using molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, or other relevant properties to aid in the classification process.

6. **Implement a Learning-based Approach**: If the structural rules become too complex or difficult to capture programmatically, you could explore machine learning techniques to learn the classification rules from a labeled dataset of examples.

It's important to note that while the program should strive to classify the provided examples correctly, it's also crucial to ensure that the classification rules align with the broader chemical understanding of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules. If there are clear outliers or inconsistencies in the provided examples, it may be justified to ignore them, but this decision should be well-reasoned and explained.
