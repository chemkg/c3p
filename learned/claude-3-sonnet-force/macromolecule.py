"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33839 macromolecule
"""
Based on the outcomes and the provided code, it seems that the program has some limitations in accurately classifying macromolecules. Here's an analysis of what went wrong and potential improvements:

1. **False Negatives**:
   - **Thioalbamide**: The program missed this macromolecule because it does not contain any of the predefined repeat unit patterns or long carbon chains. This molecule is a cyclic peptide, and the program does not specifically look for peptide-like structures. A potential improvement would be to include additional patterns or structural features characteristic of peptides or cyclic peptides.
   - **alpha-D-Manp-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1->6)]-beta-D-Manp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc**: The program missed this polysaccharide because its molecular weight (910.33 Da) is below the arbitrary threshold of 1000 Da. While this threshold is reasonable for most macromolecules, it may exclude some smaller polysaccharides or other macromolecular structures. One improvement could be to lower the molecular weight threshold or consider other factors, such as the presence of glycosidic bonds or specific polysaccharide patterns.
   - Other missed molecules: The program missed several other macromolecules, such as **6-[(1-carboxypropan-2-yl)oxy]-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxane-2-carboxylic acid**, **YM-266184**, **Ciromicin B**, and **Penochalasin C**, primarily because they do not contain the predefined repeat unit patterns or long carbon chains. These molecules likely have unique structural features characteristic of macromolecules that the program does not currently account for.

2. **False Positives**:
   - The program incorrectly classified several molecules as macromolecules, such as **N-[(3R,4R,5S,6R)-5-[(2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-3-Acetamido-5-[(2S,3S,4S,5R,6R)-4-[(2R,3S,4S,5S,6R)-3-[(2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-3-acetamido-5-hydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-4-[(2R,3R,4S,5R,6R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxyoxan-2-yl]oxy-4,5-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy-3,5-dihydroxy-6-[[(2S,3S,4S,5S,6R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxymethyl]oxan-2-yl]oxy-4-hydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy-2,4-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]acetamide** and others. These molecules likely contain repetitive units or structural features that the program mistakenly recognized as characteristic of macromolecules.

To improve the program's accuracy, several enhancements can be considered:

1. **Expand the set of repeat unit patterns**: The current set of repeat unit patterns is limited and may not cover all types of macromolecular structures. Analyzing a broader set of known macromolecules and extracting common structural patterns could help improve the program's ability to recognize macromolecular features.

2. **Incorporate machine learning techniques**: Instead of relying solely on predefined patterns, machine learning techniques could be employed to learn the structural features of macromolecules from a large dataset of known examples. This approach could potentially capture more complex and diverse macromolecular structures.

3. **Consider additional structural features**: Besides repeat units and long carbon chains, other structural features could be explored, such as the presence of specific functional groups, ring systems, or structural motifs characteristic of macromolecules.

4. **Adjust molecular weight thresholds**: The current molecular weight threshold of 1000 Da could be adjusted or replaced with a more flexible approach that considers the presence of other macromolecular features in addition to molecular weight.

5. **Implement a confidence scoring system**: Instead of a binary classification, the program could assign a confidence score based on the presence and extent of various macromolecular features. This would allow for a more nuanced classification and better handling of borderline cases or molecules with conflicting structural characteristics.

6. **Incorporate expert knowledge**: Consulting with experts in the field of macromolecular chemistry could provide valuable insights and guidance on the most relevant structural features and patterns to consider, as well as potential adjustments or refinements to the classification criteria.

It's important to note that while the program aims to classify macromolecules based on their SMILES strings, there may be inherent limitations in relying solely on structural information. In some cases, additional contextual information or experimental data may be necessary to accurately determine the macromolecular nature of a given molecule.

Overall, the program's performance could be improved by expanding the set of recognized macromolecular features, incorporating machine learning techniques, and refining the classification criteria based on expert knowledge and a larger dataset of diverse macromolecular structures.
