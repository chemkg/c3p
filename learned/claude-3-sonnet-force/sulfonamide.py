Classifies: CHEBI:35358 sulfonamide
"""
Based on the outcomes and the previous code, it seems that there are a few areas where the program could be improved:

1. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used (150-500 Da) may be too restrictive for sulfonamides. The false negatives include several examples with molecular weights outside this range, such as LSM-30893 (536.23 Da) and the compound with SMILES `C[C@@H]1CN(C(=O)CC2=C(C=CC(=C2)NC(=O)NC3CCCCC3)O[C@@H]1CN(C)S(=O)(=O)C4=CC=C(C=C4)Cl)` (620.24 Da). A broader range or no molecular weight filter at all may be more appropriate.

2. **Number of Sulfonamide Groups**: The current approach of allowing only one sulfonamide group may be too strict. Two false negatives (`N-[4-(1-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2-(1,1,3-trioxo-1,2-benzothiazol-2-yl)acetamide` and `N-[(2R,3S)-2-[[(4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl-methylamino]methyl]-5-[(2S)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl]-3-methyl-6-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzoxazocin-10-yl]-3,5-dimethyl-4-isoxazolesulfonamide`) contain two sulfonamide groups but are still considered valid sulfonamides.

3. **Specific Substructure Patterns**: The current approach relies on a general sulfonamide pattern (`S(=O)(=O)N`) and a separate check for a carbon attached to the nitrogen. However, some false negatives (`dehydroindapamide`, `N-[(2S,3S)-5-[(2R)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl]-3-methyl-2-[[methyl-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl]amino]methyl]-6-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzoxazocin-10-yl]methanesulfonamide`, etc.) were missed because they do not have a carbon directly attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen. This could potentially be addressed by using more specific substructure patterns or combining multiple patterns.

4. **False Positives**: The current program has several false positives, which could be addressed by adding additional filters or checks. For example, some of the false positives have sulfone groups (`S(=O)(=O)C`) or sulfonamide groups not directly attached to the main scaffold.

To improve the program, you could consider the following changes:

1. Remove or broaden the molecular weight range filter.
2. Allow for multiple sulfonamide groups or handle them separately.
3. Use more specific substructure patterns or combine multiple patterns to better capture the sulfonamide moiety.
4. Add additional filters or checks to eliminate false positives, such as checking for sulfone groups or ensuring the sulfonamide group is directly attached to the main scaffold.

Additionally, you could consider incorporating domain knowledge about sulfonamides, such as common structural motifs, functional groups, or other characteristics, to improve the classification accuracy.

Remember, if you believe the classifications made by your program are consistent with your understanding of the sulfonamide class, you can choose to ignore some outliers or false positives/negatives, but provide a clear justification for your decision.
