"""
Classifies: CHEBI:73011 germacranolide
"""
The previous program attempted to classify germacranolides by detecting the presence of the germacrane skeleton and a lactone ring, as well as checking for the sesquiterpene nature (15 carbon atoms) and the presence of common functional groups like alcohols, esters, exocyclic double bonds, and ketones.

However, based on the outcomes provided, the program seems to have a significant number of false negatives, meaning it is missing many true germacranolides. Let's analyze the false negatives and hypothesize about improvements:

1. **Structural Patterns:** The program uses three different SMARTS patterns to detect the germacrane skeleton. While these patterns cover some variations, they may not be comprehensive enough to capture all possible conformations and substitution patterns of the germacrane skeleton. Additionally, the program does not account for stereochemistry, which is crucial for these complex structures.

2. **Lactone Ring:** The lactone ring is correctly identified, but the program does not consider different ring sizes or positions of the lactone ring within the molecule.

3. **Functional Groups:** The program checks for common functional groups, but some germacranolides may have different or additional functional groups that are not considered.

4. **Stereochemistry:** As mentioned earlier, the program does not account for stereochemistry, which is crucial for these complex structures. Germacranolides often have multiple stereogenic centers, and their configuration is essential for their biological activity and structural classification.

To improve the program, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Expand Structural Patterns:** Instead of relying on a few predefined SMARTS patterns, we could use a more comprehensive approach to detect the germacrane skeleton. One possibility is to generate a library of known germacrane skeletons and use substructure matching to identify them in the input molecule. This would allow for better coverage of different conformations and substitution patterns.

2. **Consider Lactone Ring Size and Position:** Modify the program to consider different ring sizes and positions of the lactone ring within the molecule.

3. **Expand Functional Group Checks:** Analyze the false negatives to identify additional functional groups that may be present in germacranolides and incorporate them into the program.

4. **Incorporate Stereochemistry:** Develop a method to account for the stereochemistry of the input molecule. This could involve comparing the stereochemistry of the input molecule with known stereochemical patterns of germacranolides or using more advanced techniques like conformational analysis or molecular docking.

5. **Use Machine Learning:** As an alternative approach, you could consider using machine learning techniques to train a model on a large dataset of known germacranolides and non-germacranolides. This would allow the model to learn the complex structural patterns and stereochemical features required for accurate classification.

It's important to note that while some of the false negatives may be due to limitations in the program, there could also be errors or inconsistencies in the benchmark dataset itself. If you have a strong understanding of the chemical class and the classifications seem reasonable, you could consider ignoring some of the outliers, but be sure to explain your reasoning clearly.
