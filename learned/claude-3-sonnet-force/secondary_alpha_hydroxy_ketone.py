    Determines if a molecule is a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone based on its SMILES string.
    Secondary alpha-hydroxy ketones have a carbonyl group and a hydroxy group linked
    to the same carbon, which is also connected to an organyl group and a hydrogen.

        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
