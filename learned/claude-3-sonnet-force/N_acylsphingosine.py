"""
Classifies: CHEBI:52639 N-acylsphingosine
"""
The previous program attempted to classify N-acylsphingosines by looking for the following structural features:

1. Sphingosine backbone:
   - Double bond in the middle of a long carbon chain
   - Primary alcohol (-CH2-OH) at one end
   - Secondary amine (-NH-) at the other end
   - Specific stereochemistry (2S, 3R)
2. Amide group (-N-C(=O)-) with exactly one match
3. Fatty acid chain attached to the amide group
4. Absence of uncommon substituents like halogens, N+, S+, P+
5. Molecular weight range of 300-800 Da

While this approach is reasonable, it seems to have some limitations, as evidenced by the outcomes provided. Let's analyze the issues and propose improvements:

1. False positives:
   - The program is classifying some molecules as N-acylsphingosines even though they lack the sphingosine backbone. This could be because the patterns used to detect the backbone are too permissive or not specific enough.

2. False negatives:
   - The program is missing many true N-acylsphingosines, likely because the patterns used to detect the sphingosine backbone are too restrictive or not comprehensive enough.

To address these issues, we can make the following improvements:

1. Improve the detection of the sphingosine backbone:
   - Instead of relying on multiple separate patterns, consider using a single more comprehensive SMARTS pattern that captures the entire sphingosine backbone with the correct stereochemistry.
   - Alternatively, use a combination of smaller patterns in a more flexible way, allowing for different arrangements of the double bond, alcohol, and amine groups.

2. Relax the requirement for exactly one amide group:
   - Some N-acylsphingosines may have additional functional groups or substituents, leading to more than one amide match.
   - Instead of checking for a specific number of matches, it may be better to check if at least one amide group is present and attached to the sphingosine backbone.

3. Improve the detection of the fatty acid chain:
   - The current pattern for the fatty acid chain is quite simple and may miss more complex or branched chains.
   - Consider using a more flexible pattern that accounts for branching, double bonds, or other common variations in fatty acid chains.

4. Revisit the molecular weight range and uncommon substituent checks:
   - While these checks are reasonable, they may be too restrictive or not comprehensive enough.
   - Analyze the false positives and false negatives to determine if these checks should be adjusted or removed altogether.

5. Consider additional structural features or properties:
   - Depending on the specific examples provided, there may be additional structural features or properties that can help distinguish N-acylsphingosines from other molecules.
   - For example, you could check for the presence of a long aliphatic chain (fatty acid chain + sphingosine backbone) or specific atom count ranges.

By implementing these improvements, the program should be able to better classify N-acylsphingosines while minimizing false positives and false negatives. However, it's essential to carefully analyze the specific examples and adjust the patterns and checks accordingly.

If you encounter examples that are consistently misclassified despite your best efforts, it may be worthwhile to reconsider the benchmark or seek additional guidance on the definition and structural features of N-acylsphingosines.
