"""
Classifies: CHEBI:46640 diketone
"""
The previous program attempted to classify diketones by counting the number of ketone groups in the molecule using a SMARTS pattern. However, based on the outcomes, it appears that the program has several shortcomings:

1. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classified several molecules as diketones, even though they do not contain exactly two ketone groups. This could be due to:
   - The SMARTS pattern not being specific enough and matching other functional groups or substructures.
   - The program not accounting for other factors that could disqualify a molecule from being a diketone, such as the presence of specific substructures or functional groups.

2. **False negatives**: The program missed several true diketones, classifying them as non-diketones. This could be due to:
   - The SMARTS pattern being too restrictive and not matching certain types of ketone groups.
   - The program not considering tautomeric forms or resonance structures that could contain ketone groups.

3. **Enol forms**: The program attempts to exclude enol forms of ketones by using a negated SMARTS pattern (`!@[OX2H1]`). However, this may not be sufficient to cover all possible enol forms, leading to incorrect classifications.

To improve the program, we could consider the following approaches:

1. **Refine the SMARTS pattern**: Analyze the false positives and false negatives to understand the limitations of the current SMARTS pattern. Modify the pattern or use multiple patterns to cover a wider range of ketone groups while avoiding matching other functional groups or substructures.

2. **Incorporate additional checks**: In addition to counting the number of ketone groups, incorporate additional checks to ensure that the molecule meets other criteria for being a diketone. This could include checking for specific substructures, functional groups, or structural features that are incompatible with diketones.

3. **Handle tautomeric forms and resonance structures**: Consider generating tautomeric forms and resonance structures of the input molecule and checking for the presence of ketone groups in these alternative representations.

4. **Use machine learning or rule-based approaches**: Instead of relying solely on a SMARTS pattern, you could explore machine learning approaches or more complex rule-based systems that can learn from the provided examples and generalize better to new cases.

5. **Manually curate the benchmark data**: Since there may be systematic mistakes in the benchmark data, it would be helpful to manually curate the data, cross-checking the classifications with other sources or expert knowledge. This could help identify and correct any errors in the benchmark, leading to more accurate assessments of the program's performance.

It's important to note that the classification of chemical entities can be a complex task, and a single approach may not be sufficient to cover all cases accurately. Combining multiple techniques and incorporating domain knowledge may be necessary to achieve robust and reliable classifications.
