Based on the error message and the previous code, it seems that the issue lies in the `rdkit` module not having the `Mol.GetNumRotatableBonds()` method. This method is likely part of the `rdMolDescriptors` module, which is imported in the previous code for classifying triglycerides.

To address this issue, we need to import the `rdMolDescriptors` module and use the appropriate method from there. Additionally, we can improve the code by adding more checks to ensure that the molecule meets the criteria for a fatty alcohol.

Here's the improved code:
