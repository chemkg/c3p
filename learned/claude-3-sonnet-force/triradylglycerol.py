"""
Classifies: CHEBI:76579 triradylglycerol
"""
After reviewing the previous code and the provided examples, I believe the issue lies in the way the substituents are identified. The code appears to be overly simplistic and may not accurately capture the complexity of the triradylglycerol structures.

Here are a few observations and potential improvements:

1. **Smarts Pattern Limitations**: The current Smarts patterns used to identify ester groups, alkyl chains, and alkenyl chains may not be sufficient to capture all possible variations. For example, the alkyl pattern `"[CX4]~[CX4]"` may not match longer or branched alkyl chains.

2. **Substituent Identification**: The method of identifying substituents by checking the neighbors of each oxygen atom may not be robust enough. It assumes a specific connectivity pattern, which may not hold true for all triradylglycerol structures.

3. **Substituent Length/Branching**: The current implementation does not consider the length or branching of the substituents. Some examples provided have long and branched alkyl/alkenyl chains, which the current code may not handle correctly.

4. **Stereochemistry**: The examples provided include stereochemical information (e.g., `/` and `\` bonds), which the current code does not account for.

To improve the classification, we need a more comprehensive approach that can handle the diverse structures of triradylglycerols. Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Use Molecular Fingerprints**: Instead of relying on Smarts patterns, we can use molecular fingerprints to encode the structural features of the molecule. This would allow us to capture more complex patterns and potentially learn from the provided examples.

2. **Implement a Machine Learning Model**: With a suitable fingerprint representation, we can train a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, support vector machine) on the provided examples to learn the structural characteristics of triradylglycerols.

3. **Incorporate Expert Rules**: In addition to the machine learning model, we can incorporate expert rules based on the chemical knowledge of triradylglycerols. For example, we can check for the presence of a glycerol backbone, count the number of substituents, and verify their types (acyl, alkyl, alk-1-enyl).

4. **Handle Stereochemistry**: We need to find a way to account for stereochemical information in the SMILES strings, either by incorporating it into the fingerprint representation or by explicitly handling it in the expert rules.

5. **Expand the Training Set**: If possible, it would be beneficial to expand the training set with more diverse examples of triradylglycerols to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

While the previous code made a reasonable attempt, the complexity of the triradylglycerol class likely necessitates a more sophisticated approach. By combining machine learning techniques with expert knowledge, we can develop a more robust and accurate classification program.
