"""
Classifies: CHEBI:73155 trienoic fatty acid

Based on the error message and the previous code, it seems that the issue is with the `GetSubstructMatches` function. The error message indicates that the function is not accepting `None` as an argument, which means that the `MolFromSmarts` function is returning `None` for some reason.

One possible issue could be that the SMARTS patterns used in the code are not valid or are not being recognized correctly by RDKit. Another possibility is that the SMILES strings being passed to the function are not valid or are not being parsed correctly by RDKit.

To improve the program, we can try the following:

1. **Validate SMARTS patterns**: We should double-check that the SMARTS patterns used in the code are valid and consistent with the chemical class definition. We can use the `MolFromSmarts` function to test the patterns and make sure they are not returning `None`.

2. **Handle invalid SMILES strings**: We should add more robust error handling for invalid SMILES strings. Instead of simply returning `False` and an "Invalid SMILES string" message, we could try to catch specific errors related to SMILES parsing and provide more informative error messages.

3. **Consider alternative approaches**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, we could explore alternative approaches to identifying the chemical features of interest. For example, we could use RDKit's built-in functions to count and analyze specific types of atoms, bonds, and functional groups.

4. **Revisit the chemical class definition**: If the current approach proves to be too complex or unreliable, we might need to revisit the chemical class definition and consider alternative ways to define and identify trienoic fatty acids.

5. **Analyze the benchmark data**: While the benchmark data may not be 100% accurate, it can still provide valuable insights. We should analyze the true positives, false positives, and false negatives to understand the patterns and potential issues with the current approach.

6. **Use your chemical knowledge**: As mentioned, you have a strong understanding of chemistry, and you should use your knowledge to evaluate the correctness of the program's classifications. If the program's classifications align with your understanding of the chemical class, you can ignore outliers in the benchmark data and explain your reasoning.

It's important to note that developing reliable and robust chemical classification programs can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex chemical classes and potential ambiguities in the data. However, by combining your chemical knowledge with effective error handling, alternative approaches, and iterative refinement, you can improve the program's performance and reliability.
