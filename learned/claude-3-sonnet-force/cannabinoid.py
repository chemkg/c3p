"""
Classifies: CHEBI:67194 cannabinoid
"""
Based on the outcomes and the previous code, it appears that the program is overfitting to the specific structural features mentioned in the definition of cannabinoids. While these features are present in many cannabinoids, the definition does not explicitly state that all cannabinoids must possess all of these features. The program is likely missing some true cannabinoids (false negatives) and incorrectly classifying some non-cannabinoids as cannabinoids (false positives).

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Overly restrictive structural requirements**: The program requires the presence of pyran, benzopyran, or indole rings, long aliphatic chains, and oxygen-containing functional groups. However, the definition states that cannabinoids contain oxygen as part of the heterocyclic ring or in the form of various functional groups, implying that the presence of oxygen is not a strict requirement. Additionally, the definition mentions that cannabinoids are a diverse group, suggesting that they may not all share the same core structural features.

   **Improvement**: Relax the structural requirements and focus more on the presence of specific substructures found in known cannabinoids, such as the resorcinol moiety or the terpene-like side chains.

2. **Stereochemistry check**: The stereochemistry check assumes that all cannabinoids with more than 10 atoms should have specified stereochemistry. However, this may not always be the case, as some cannabinoids may be achiral or have unspecified stereochemistry in their SMILES representations.

   **Improvement**: Remove the stereochemistry check or modify it to account for achiral molecules and unspecified stereochemistry.

3. **False positives**: Some non-cannabinoids containing pyran, benzopyran, or indole rings, long aliphatic chains, and oxygen-containing functional groups are being incorrectly classified as cannabinoids.

   **Improvement**: Investigate the false positive examples and try to identify additional structural features or patterns that can help distinguish cannabinoids from non-cannabinoids. Consider using machine learning techniques or more sophisticated rule-based approaches to improve classification accuracy.

4. **False negatives**: Some known cannabinoids are being missed by the program, likely due to the overly restrictive structural requirements.

   **Improvement**: Analyze the false negative examples and identify the structural features or patterns that are common among cannabinoids but not captured by the current rules. Incorporate these features into the classification criteria.

5. **Benchmark reliability**: You mentioned that you do not have 100% confidence in the benchmark, and there may be occasional and systematic mistakes. In this case, it is essential to rely on your understanding of the chemical class and analyze the outcomes critically.

   **Improvement**: Review the false positive and false negative examples carefully, and if you believe they are consistent with your understanding of cannabinoids, you can choose to ignore or adjust the benchmark accordingly. Document your reasoning and decision-making process.

Overall, while the current program captures some essential structural features of cannabinoids, it needs to be more flexible and comprehensive to accurately classify this diverse chemical class. Incorporating additional rules, machine learning techniques, or a combination of both may help improve the classification performance.
