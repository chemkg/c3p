"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36500 glucosylceramide
"""
Based on the outcomes and the previous code, it seems that the program is correctly identifying most of the glucosylceramides, but it is missing some cases. Here are my hypotheses and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Ceramide backbone pattern**: The current pattern `"[NX3H2;$(NC(=O)C)][CX4H](C[CX4])([CX4])[CX3](=O)[OX2H]"` is not capturing all possible ceramide backbones. Some of the false negatives have a double bond in the sphingoid base chain, which is not accounted for in the current pattern. Additionally, the pattern does not allow for different substituents on the ceramide backbone, such as methyl groups.

Suggestion: Use a more general pattern or a combination of patterns to capture a wider range of ceramide backbones, including those with double bonds and substituents.

2. **Glucose moiety pattern**: The current pattern `"[OX2;$([C@H]1[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)O)O)O)O[CX4;!$(NC=O)])][CX4]"` is specific to the glucose moiety. However, glucosylceramides can also have the glucose attached via an ester bond, which is not captured by this pattern.

Suggestion: Modify the glucose pattern to include the possibility of an ester bond, or use a separate pattern to check for this case.

3. **Ether/ester bond pattern**: The current patterns `"[OX2;$([C@H]1[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)O)O)O)O[CX4;!$(NC=O)])][CX4;$(NC(=O)C)]"` and `"[OX2;$([C@H]1[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)O)O)O)O[CX3]=O)]"` are correct, but they may be too specific and miss some cases.

Suggestion: Consider using a more general pattern or a combination of patterns to capture the ether/ester bond between the glucose moiety and the ceramide backbone.

4. **Carbon and oxygen count**: The thresholds of 20 carbons and 8 oxygens seem reasonable, but they may be too strict in some cases, especially for glucosylceramides with longer fatty acid chains or additional substituents.

Suggestion: Consider relaxing these thresholds or using a more flexible approach based on the molecular weight or other molecular descriptors.

5. **Handling exceptions**: Some of the false negatives may be due to specific structural features or exceptions that are not captured by the current patterns. For example, some glucosylceramides may have additional substituents or unusual structural motifs.

Suggestion: Analyze the false negatives carefully and consider adding additional checks or patterns to handle specific exceptions or edge cases.

Overall, the program is on the right track, but it may need some refinements to capture a broader range of glucosylceramides, especially those with variations in the ceramide backbone or the glucose attachment. Additionally, carefully reviewing the false negatives and false positives can provide valuable insights for further improvements.
