"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36500 glucosylceramide
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it appears that the ceramide backbone detection patterns used in the code are not comprehensive enough to identify all glucosylceramide structures. The false negatives suggest that the program missed some valid glucosylceramide structures due to the limitations of the SMARTS patterns used.

Here's how we can improve the program:

1. **Expand the ceramide backbone patterns**: The current patterns cover standard ceramides, ceramides with double bonds, and ceramides with substituents. However, they may not cover all possible variations of the ceramide backbone. We can explore more general patterns or combine multiple patterns to ensure better coverage.

2. **Improve glucose moiety detection**: While the current glucose patterns cover glycosidic and ester bonds, they may not account for all possible conformations and substitutions of the glucose moiety. We can explore more flexible patterns or use additional checks to ensure robust detection.

3. **Consider additional checks**: In addition to the substructure matching, we can incorporate additional checks or constraints based on the molecular properties or features specific to glucosylceramides. For example, we could check for the presence of a specific number of nitrogen, oxygen, and other atoms, or enforce specific bond types or stereochemistry.

4. **Evaluate and refine patterns**: After implementing the above improvements, we should thoroughly evaluate the program on a diverse set of glucosylceramide structures, including the false negatives from the previous attempt. Based on the evaluation results, we can further refine the patterns and checks to achieve better performance.

It's important to note that while the benchmark data is not 100% reliable, it can still provide valuable guidance. However, if the classifications made by your program are consistent with your understanding of the chemical class and the provided definition, you can choose to ignore outliers or false negatives that seem reasonable. In such cases, it's essential to document your reasoning and justification for accepting or rejecting specific outcomes.

By iteratively refining the patterns, incorporating additional checks, and thoroughly evaluating the program on diverse data, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of the glucosylceramide classification.
