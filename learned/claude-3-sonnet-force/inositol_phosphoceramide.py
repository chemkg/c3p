"""
Classifies: CHEBI:60245 inositol phosphoceramide
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, I can identify a few potential issues:

1. **Inositol Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the inositol residue is too specific and may not account for all possible stereochemical configurations or ring conformations. Inositol is a cyclic polyol with multiple chiral centers, and the pattern used assumes a specific stereochemistry and ring conformation.

2. **Phosphodiester Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the phosphodiester group is too specific and may not account for different connectivities or stereochemistries around the phosphate group.

3. **Ceramide Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the ceramide moiety is too restrictive and may not account for different chain lengths, substitutions, or stereochemistries of the sphingoid base and fatty acid components.

4. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used as a filter may be too narrow or not representative of the entire class of inositol phosphoceramides.

To improve the program, we can consider the following modifications:

1. **Inositol Pattern**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern for the inositol residue, such as `[C@H]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]1O)O)O)O)O`, which does not specify the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl groups.

2. **Phosphodiester Pattern**: Use a more general SMARTS pattern for the phosphodiester group, such as `O=P(O[C@@H])O[C@@H]`, which captures the connectivity without specifying the stereochemistry or substituents.

3. **Ceramide Pattern**: Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for the ceramide moiety, such as `[N;H2,H1]CCC[C@@H]([C@@H](C)CC).CCCCCCCCCC(=O)`, which allows for different chain lengths and substituents on the sphingoid base and fatty acid components.

4. **Molecular Weight Range**: Expand or remove the molecular weight range filter, as it may not be a reliable criterion for classifying inositol phosphoceramides.

5. **Additional Checks**: Consider adding additional checks or filters based on the chemical properties or substructures that are essential for inositol phosphoceramides, such as the presence of a long aliphatic chain, the presence of a primary amide group, or the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups.

It's important to note that the benchmark data may contain errors or inconsistencies, and it's reasonable to question or ignore outliers if they contradict our chemical understanding of the class. However, it's also essential to ensure that our program is not overly narrow or specific, as it may fail to capture the diversity of structures within the class.
