"""
Classifies: CHEBI:22798 beta-D-glucoside
"""
Based on the previous code and the outcomes, it seems that the program is able to correctly identify the presence of a D-glucose substructure, but it is not accurately detecting the beta-configuration at the anomeric center. The reason for this could be that the program is relying solely on the CIP (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) code to determine the configuration, which may not be reliable for all molecules.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and potential improvements:

1. **False negatives**: Several examples that were classified as false negatives do contain a D-glucose substructure with a beta-configuration at the anomeric center. This indicates that the program is missing some valid cases. Examples: (-)-secologanin, raucaffricine, 3beta-[(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]-17alpha-hydroxy-16beta-[(O-(2-O-3,4-dimethoxybenzoyl-beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-(1->3)-2-O-acetyl-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl)oxy]cholest-5-en-22-one, and others.

2. **False positives**: There are no false positives reported, which is good. However, it's possible that the program may be missing some false positive cases.

3. **Reliance on CIP code**: The program relies solely on the CIP code to determine the beta-configuration at the anomeric center. This may not be reliable for all molecules, especially those with complex stereochemistry or those where the CIP code is not assigned correctly by the RDKit.

To improve the program, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Use additional checks for beta-configuration**: Instead of relying solely on the CIP code, we can use additional checks to determine the beta-configuration at the anomeric center. One approach could be to analyze the dihedral angles around the anomeric center and compare them with the expected values for alpha and beta configurations.

2. **Handle multiple D-glucose substructures**: Some of the false negative examples contain multiple D-glucose substructures. The program should be modified to handle such cases and check the configuration at all anomeric centers.

3. **Implement more rigorous substructure matching**: The current approach of using a SMARTS pattern for D-glucose may not be sufficient for all cases. We could explore more advanced substructure matching techniques or use a combination of SMARTS patterns to improve the detection of D-glucose substructures.

4. **Analyze false positives**: While there are no reported false positives, it would be beneficial to analyze a larger set of examples to ensure that the program is not generating false positives in other cases.

5. **Consider alternative approaches**: If the above improvements do not yield satisfactory results, we could explore alternative approaches, such as using machine learning models trained on the structural and chemical properties of beta-D-glucosides.

By addressing these issues and implementing the suggested improvements, the program's accuracy in classifying beta-D-glucosides should improve significantly.
