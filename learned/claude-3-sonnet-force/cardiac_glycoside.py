Classifies: CHEBI:83970 cardiac glycoside
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it appears that the primary issue lies in the definition of the cardiac glycoside class and the chosen substructure patterns used for identification.

The definition provided states that a cardiac glycoside is "a steroid lactone containing sugar residues that acts on the contractile force of cardiac muscles." However, the program only checks for the presence of a steroid backbone with a lactone ring and the presence of sugar residues, without considering their specific connectivity or the biological activity.

Many of the false negatives, such as Cymarol, lanatoside C, and 3beta-[(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-4,6-dideoxy-2-O-methyl-beta-D-gulopyranosyl)]-5beta,14beta-dihydroxy-19-oxocard-20(22)enolide, contain steroid backbones and sugar residues but might not necessarily act on the contractile force of cardiac muscles, which is a key aspect of the definition.

To improve the program, a more specific definition of cardiac glycosides should be considered, focusing on the structural features that confer the desired biological activity. Additionally, the substructure patterns should be refined to capture the specific connectivity between the steroid backbone and the sugar residues, as well as any other relevant functional groups or substituents that contribute to the activity.

It is also worth noting that the benchmark itself might not be entirely reliable, as mentioned in the note. Therefore, it is essential to rely on your understanding of chemistry and the chemical class in question, while using the benchmark as a guide rather than an absolute truth.

If you are confident that your program correctly identifies the relevant structural features of cardiac glycosides based on your chemical knowledge, you could consider ignoring some of the outliers in the benchmark, but provide a clear explanation for your reasoning.

Alternatively, you could explore alternative approaches, such as using machine learning models trained on a curated dataset of cardiac glycosides, or incorporating additional rules or filters based on the specific biological activity or other relevant properties.
