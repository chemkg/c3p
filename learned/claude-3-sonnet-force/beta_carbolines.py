"""
Classifies: CHEBI:60834 beta-carbolines
"""
Thank you for the detailed examples and feedback. Let me analyze the previous program and the outcomes:

The previous program attempted to identify beta-carbolines by looking for the presence of a pyridoindole core and additional fused or spiro-fused rings. However, it seems that this approach was too narrow and missed some valid beta-carboline structures.

Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. The pyridoindole core pattern `[*]1nc2ccccc2c3[nH]ccc13` was too specific and missed some valid beta-carboline structures with substitutions on the pyridine or indole rings.

Improvement: Use a more general pattern for the core, such as `[*]1nc2ccccc2c3[nH]ccc13`, which allows for substitutions.

2. The ring patterns used to identify additional fused or spiro-fused rings were also too specific and missed some valid structures.

Improvement: Instead of enumerating specific ring patterns, use a more general approach to identify the beta-carboline skeleton and potential fused or spiro-fused rings.

3. The program did not consider the possibility of hydrogenated derivatives of the beta-carboline skeleton, which are also part of the definition of this class.

Improvement: Add a more general check for hydrogenated derivatives, rather than relying on a specific pattern.

4. Some of the false negatives in the outcomes (e.g., Trichotomine, 9-hydroxyfumitremorgin C) seem to be valid beta-carboline structures, but were missed by the program. This suggests that the benchmark data may have some inconsistencies or errors.

Improvement: Review the benchmark data and, if necessary, adjust the program's logic based on a clear understanding of the chemical class definition.

With these observations in mind, I will attempt to improve the program to better identify beta-carboline structures.
