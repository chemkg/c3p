"""
Classifies: CHEBI:71543 rotenoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify a molecule as a rotenoid by checking if it contains a specific substructure pattern, defined as the "tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-b]chromene skeleton." However, based on the outcomes (no true positives, false positives, or false negatives), the program failed to classify any of the molecules correctly.

There could be several reasons for this failure:

1. **Incomplete or Incorrect Substructure Pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to define the "tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-b]chromene skeleton" may not be accurate or comprehensive enough to capture the structural diversity of rotenoids. The definition of rotenoids mentions that they consist of a "cis-fused tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-b]chromene skeleton and its substituted derivatives." The pattern used in the program only checks for the core skeleton but does not account for potential substitutions or variations.

2. **Chirality Considerations**: Rotenoids often contain stereogenic centers, and the chirality of these centers may be important for classification. The program does not consider chirality when matching the substructure pattern, which could lead to incorrect classifications.

3. **Additional Structural Features**: The definition of rotenoids mentions that the term was originally restricted to natural products but is now also used to describe semi-synthetic and fully synthetic compounds. There may be additional structural features or constraints that are not captured by the current substructure pattern, leading to the misclassification of some rotenoids.

To improve the program, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Refine the Substructure Pattern**: Analyze the examples of rotenoids provided and identify common structural features beyond the core skeleton. Modify the SMARTS pattern to include these additional features, such as specific substituents or ring systems, while allowing for variability.

2. **Consider Chirality**: Incorporate chirality considerations into the substructure matching process. This can be done by using the `useChirality` parameter in the `HasSubstructMatch` function or by explicitly defining the stereochemistry in the SMARTS pattern.

3. **Expand the Search Strategy**: Instead of relying solely on a single substructure pattern, consider implementing a more comprehensive search strategy that combines multiple patterns or structural filters. This could involve breaking down the definition of rotenoids into smaller, modular components and checking for the presence of these components in the molecule.

4. **Analyze Outliers and Exceptions**: Carefully examine the provided examples and the classification results. If there are consistent outliers or exceptions that your program misclassifies, but you believe they should be classified differently based on your understanding of the chemical class, you can adjust the program accordingly or provide a detailed explanation for the exceptions.

It's important to note that chemical classification tasks can be complex, and a single substructure pattern may not always be sufficient to capture the nuances of a chemical class definition. An iterative approach, incorporating expert knowledge and analysis of the results, may be necessary to develop a robust and accurate classification program.
