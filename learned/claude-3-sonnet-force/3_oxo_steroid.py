"""
Classifies: CHEBI:47788 3-oxo steroid
"""
The previous attempt failed because the SMARTS patterns used to detect the steroid backbone and the oxo group at position 3 were too specific and rigid. SMARTS patterns should be as general as possible while still capturing the essential features of the target structure.

Here are some potential improvements:

1. Simplify the steroid backbone pattern:
   - Remove explicit ring numbering and atom mapping, as these are not necessary for detecting the backbone.
   - Use more general atom specifications (e.g., `[C]` instead of `[C@]`) where stereochemistry is not essential.
   - Use ring specifications (e.g., `r1`, `r2`) to ensure the correct ring connectivity without specifying exact atom positions.

2. Separate the detection of the oxo group at position 3 from the backbone pattern:
   - Use a separate SMARTS pattern to look for the oxo group at position 3, independent of the backbone pattern.
   - This allows for more flexibility in the backbone structure while still ensuring the presence of the oxo group at the correct position.

3. Consider additional checks or constraints:
   - Molecular weight range: 3-oxo steroids typically have a molecular weight within a certain range.
   - Ring count: Steroids have a specific number of rings (usually four fused rings).
   - Carbon count: Steroids have a specific number of carbon atoms (usually around 17-21).

4. Analyze the provided examples:
   - Look for common structural features or patterns among the positive examples.
   - Identify any potential false negatives or false positives in the examples and adjust the patterns accordingly.

5. Handle tautomers and stereochemistry:
   - Steroids can exist as different tautomers or stereoisomers, which may require additional handling or consideration.
   - Decide whether stereochemistry is essential for the classification or if it can be ignored.

6. Consider using more advanced techniques:
   - Machine learning models or rule-based systems trained on a larger dataset of 3-oxo steroids and non-3-oxo steroids may provide better classification accuracy.
   - However, this approach may be more complex and require additional data and resources.

By incorporating these improvements, the program should be able to more accurately classify 3-oxo steroids based on their SMILES strings. It's important to strike a balance between specificity and generality in the patterns used, and to thoroughly test the program against a diverse set of examples.
