"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23003 carbamate ester
"""
Upon reviewing the previous code and the outcomes, it appears that the current approach of solely looking for the carbamate functional group pattern (-O-C(=O)-N-) is not sufficient to accurately classify carbamate esters. While this pattern is present in carbamate esters, it can also be found in other chemical classes, leading to false positives.

To improve the classification, we need to incorporate additional checks and constraints to ensure that the identified functional group is indeed a carbamate ester and not just a substructure present in other chemical classes.

Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Check for ester linkage**: In addition to the carbamate functional group, we should verify that the nitrogen atom is linked to an alkoxy or aryloxy group, forming an ester.

2. **Check for substitution on nitrogen**: Carbamate esters often have substituted nitrogen atoms, so we could look for substituents like alkyl, aryl, or acyl groups attached to the nitrogen.

3. **Exclude certain substructures**: Some false positives, like pyridostigmine, could be excluded by checking for specific substructures that are not allowed in carbamate esters.

4. **Molecular weight and atom count restrictions**: We could apply filters based on molecular weight and atom counts to exclude molecules that are too small or too large to be carbamate esters.

5. **Additional structural constraints**: Explore other structural constraints or patterns that are specific to carbamate esters and not present in other chemical classes.

6. **Use machine learning models**: As an alternative approach, we could train a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of carbamate esters and non-carbamate esters to learn the relevant features and patterns for accurate classification.

When dealing with complex chemical classes, it is often necessary to incorporate multiple checks and constraints to improve the accuracy of the classification. Additionally, carefully analyzing the false positives and false negatives can provide valuable insights into the weaknesses of the current approach and guide the development of better classification strategies.

It's important to note that the benchmark dataset itself may contain errors or inconsistencies, so it's essential to use your chemical knowledge and judgment to evaluate the classifications and make necessary adjustments if warranted.
