"""
Classifies: CHEBI:10036 wax ester
"""
The previous program attempted to classify wax esters by looking for the following key features:

1. Presence of exactly one ester group (-O-C(=O)-).
2. A fatty acid chain (long carbon chain) attached to the carbonyl carbon of the ester group.
3. A fatty alcohol chain (long carbon chain with a terminal oxygen) attached to the oxygen of the ester group.
4. A minimum number of rotatable bonds (10) to ensure the chains are long enough.
5. A minimum number of carbon atoms (20) to ensure the molecule is large enough.
6. Exactly two oxygen atoms, corresponding to the single ester group.

Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the program performs reasonably well, with several true positives and negatives. However, there are some issues and potential improvements to consider:

1. **False positives**: The program incorrectly classified some molecules as wax esters, even though they do not contain the required ester group or lack the fatty acid/alcohol chains. This could be due to the patterns used for matching being too permissive or not accounting for certain structural variations.

2. **False negatives**: The program missed some valid wax esters, particularly those with additional functional groups or structural features beyond the basic ester and fatty chains. For example, the false negative "9-Hydroxytridecyl docosanoate" has an additional hydroxyl group, which violates the rule of having exactly two oxygens.

3. **Pattern matching improvements**: The patterns used for matching fatty acid and fatty alcohol chains could be too restrictive or not accounting for certain branching patterns or unsaturations. More flexible patterns or multiple patterns could be used to improve coverage.

4. **Handling additional functional groups**: The program could be extended to handle wax esters with additional functional groups or substituents, as long as the core ester and fatty chains are present. This could involve additional pattern matching or more sophisticated structural analysis.

5. **Molecular properties**: While the program checks for the number of rotatable bonds and carbon atoms, it could also consider other molecular properties like molecular weight or atom counts to refine the classification criteria.

6. **Confidence scores**: Instead of a binary classification, the program could return a confidence score based on the degree of matching with the expected patterns and properties. This could help identify borderline cases or provide a more nuanced classification.

Overall, while the program seems to have a reasonable foundation, there is room for improvement, particularly in handling a wider range of structural variations and accommodating additional functional groups. Additionally, incorporating more sophisticated pattern matching or structural analysis techniques could further enhance the accuracy and coverage of the classification.

Given the potential systematic mistakes in the benchmark, it is reasonable to ignore some of the outliers, especially if they violate the fundamental definition of a wax ester (e.g., missing the ester group or lacking fatty chains). However, it is essential to critically evaluate each false positive or negative and determine if it represents a genuine limitation in the program or an issue with the benchmark itself.
