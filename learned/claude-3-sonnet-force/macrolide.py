"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25106 macrolide
"""
The previous code attempted to classify macrolides based on the following criteria:

1. The molecule must contain a ring with 12 or more atoms.
2. The largest ring must contain a lactone (ester of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in a ring).
3. The molecule must be derived from a polyketide (a structure with repeating -C-C-C-C- units).

The failure to correctly classify any molecules as macrolides or non-macrolides suggests that there might be issues with the implemented criteria or the way they were coded.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and improvements:

1. **Issue with detecting the largest ring size**: The code uses `rdmolring.GetRingInfo` to find the largest ring size, but this module is not part of the standard RDKit installation. It might be causing an import error, leading to the failure. A better approach would be to use the built-in RDKit functions like `Chem.rdmolops.GetMacroRingMolecules` or `Chem.GetSymmSSSR` to find the macrocyclic rings.

2. **Lactone detection**: The code looks for a lactone pattern within the largest ring atoms. However, the lactone might not be part of the macrocycle itself but rather attached to it. A better approach would be to check for the presence of a lactone substructure anywhere in the molecule.

3. **Polyketide detection**: The code uses a specific SMARTS pattern to detect a polyketide structure. This pattern might be too specific and miss some polyketide-derived macrolides. Instead, you could check for the presence of long carbon chains or use a more general pattern like `[C]~[C]~[C]~[C]` to detect polyketide-like structures.

4. **Additional criteria**: The definition of macrolides also mentions that they are derived from polyketides. You could check for the presence of polyketide-like structural features, such as long carbon chains or specific functional groups (e.g., ketones, hydroxyls) common in polyketides.

5. **False positives and negatives**: It's possible that the benchmark dataset itself might have some incorrect classifications, leading to false positives or false negatives. In such cases, you might need to use your chemical knowledge and judgment to determine if the program's classifications are reasonable, even if they don't match the benchmark perfectly.

To improve the program, you could try the following:

1. Use built-in RDKit functions to detect macrocyclic rings with 12 or more atoms.
2. Check for the presence of a lactone substructure anywhere in the molecule, not just within the largest ring.
3. Use a more general pattern or check for polyketide-like structural features to identify polyketide-derived molecules.
4. Consider additional criteria based on the definition of macrolides, such as the presence of specific functional groups or structural motifs.
5. Carefully analyze any discrepancies between your program's classifications and the benchmark, and use your chemical knowledge to determine if the program's classifications are reasonable.

By addressing these potential issues and incorporating improvements, you should be able to create a more robust program for classifying macrolides based on their SMILES strings.
