"""
Classifies: CHEBI:71971 neoflavonoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify neoflavonoids based on the presence of a benzopyran core and an aryl substituent at position 4. However, the outcomes indicate that the program missed several true positives, suggesting that the implemented criteria were too strict or had some shortcomings.

Here's my analysis and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Missed true positives**: The program missed many known neoflavonoid structures, such as Mammea A/AA, Mammea A/BA, Mesuol, and others. This suggests that the implemented criteria were too restrictive or did not account for all possible neoflavonoid structural variations.

2. **Benzopyran core detection**: The SMARTS pattern used to detect the benzopyran core ([c&r4]1[c&r3][c&r4][c&r3][c&r4][c&r3]2[O&r3][C&r4][c&r3][c&r4][c&r3]12) may be too specific and could miss some valid benzopyran structures. It might be better to use a more flexible pattern or combine multiple patterns to cover a broader range of benzopyran variations.

3. **Aryl substituent detection**: The program only checks for a single aryl substituent at position 4 of the benzopyran core. However, some neoflavonoids may have additional substituents or variations in the aryl group. It might be necessary to consider these variations or use a more flexible pattern to detect the aryl group.

4. **Additional checks**: The program includes additional checks for the number of rotatable bonds and molecular weight. While these checks can help exclude some non-neoflavonoid structures, they may also inadvertently exclude valid neoflavonoids. It might be better to rely more on the structural patterns and less on these additional checks, unless they are essential for distinguishing neoflavonoids from other classes.

To improve the program, here's what you could try:

1. **Review and expand the structural patterns**: Analyze the missed true positive examples and identify common structural features or patterns that were not covered by the current implementation. Expand the SMARTS patterns or use multiple patterns to cover a broader range of valid neoflavonoid structures.

2. **Consider alternative approaches**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, you could explore other approaches, such as using RDKit's built-in functionality for substructure matching or implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that considers various structural features and their combinations.

3. **Incorporate domain knowledge**: Consult the literature or consult with experts in the field to better understand the structural variations and boundaries of the neoflavonoid class. This knowledge can help refine the criteria and improve the accuracy of the classification.

4. **Iterative refinement**: Implement the suggested improvements, evaluate the results on a larger and more diverse dataset, and iteratively refine the criteria based on the outcomes and analysis of any remaining misclassifications.

It's important to note that the benchmark data may not be perfect, and there could be systematic mistakes or ambiguities in the classification of some structures. In such cases, it's reasonable to rely on your domain knowledge and expertise to make informed decisions about which structures should be classified as neoflavonoids, while providing a clear rationale for any deviations from the benchmark.
