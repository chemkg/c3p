"""
Classifies: CHEBI:33916 aldopentose
"""
The previous program attempted to classify aldopentose molecules based on the following criteria:

1. Exactly 5 carbon atoms
2. Presence of an aldehyde group
3. Presence of 4 hydroxyl groups
4. Presence of a ring structure (furanose or pyranose form)

While these criteria are generally correct for identifying aldopentoses, the program missed some key points, leading to the false negatives observed in the outcomes.

1. **No aldehyde group found**: The program correctly identified the aldehyde group using the `[CH]=O` SMARTS pattern. However, some aldopentoses can have an open-chain form without a cyclic structure, where the aldehyde group is represented as `C=O` instead of `[CH]=O`. This explains why molecules like "aldehydo-L-xylose" and "aldehydo-D-arabinose" were missed.

2. **No ring found, aldopentoses typically have furanose or pyranose forms**: While aldopentoses commonly exist in cyclic furanose or pyranose forms, they can also have open-chain structures. The program should not strictly require a ring structure to classify a molecule as an aldopentose.

3. **Found 6 carbon atoms, aldopentoses must have 5**: The program correctly checks for 5 carbon atoms. However, some aldopentoses like "beta-D-hamamelose" can have additional functional groups or substituents that increase the total number of carbon atoms. The program should be more flexible in this regard.

4. **No aldehyde group found**: Some molecules classified as false negatives, such as "beta-L-lyxofuranose" and "alpha-D-lyxopyranose," do not contain an aldehyde group. These are not aldopentoses and should be correctly classified as negatives.

To improve the program, we can make the following modifications:

1. Expand the aldehyde group pattern to include both `[CH]=O` and `C=O` forms.
2. Remove the strict requirement for a ring structure.
3. Allow for some flexibility in the number of carbon atoms, as long as there is a pentose backbone.
4. Refine the criteria for identifying true aldopentoses by checking for the presence of both an aldehyde group and a pentose backbone.

By incorporating these changes, the program should be able to more accurately classify aldopentose molecules while minimizing false negatives and false positives.
