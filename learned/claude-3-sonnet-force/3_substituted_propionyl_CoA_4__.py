"""
Classifies: CHEBI:65111 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-)
"""
The previous program attempts to classify a molecule as a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of the CoA backbone.
2. Presence of a 3-substituted propionyl group attached to the sulfur atom.
3. Presence of double bonds in the acyl chain (optional).
4. Presence of deprotonated phosphate and diphosphate groups.

However, the program has some limitations that might have led to the poor performance observed in the outcomes:

1. **Misinterpretation of the class definition**: The program assumes that the presence of a 3-substituted propionyl group attached to the sulfur atom is a requirement for the class. However, the class definition states that it includes "any 3-substituted propionyl-CoA" that has been deprotonated. This means that the 3-substitution can be anywhere in the molecule, not necessarily attached to the sulfur atom.

2. **Overly restrictive pattern matching**: The program uses very specific SMARTS patterns to match the CoA backbone and the 3-substituted propionyl group. While this approach can work for some cases, it may fail to capture the structural diversity present in the class. A more flexible approach that considers the overall connectivity and functional groups might be better.

3. **Ignoring stereochemistry**: The program does not consider the stereochemistry of the molecules, which can be important for distinguishing different isomers within the class.

4. **Ignoring charge and pH considerations**: The class definition explicitly mentions that the molecules are "oxoanions arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups... at pH 7.3." The program checks for the presence of deprotonated phosphate groups but does not consider the overall charge or pH conditions.

To improve the program, the following changes could be considered:

1. **Broaden the definition of a 3-substituted propionyl group**: Instead of looking for a specific substitution pattern, consider checking for the presence of a propionyl group (CC(=O)C) with any substitution on the central carbon atom.

2. **Use more flexible substructure matching**: Instead of relying on specific SMARTS patterns, consider using more general substructure matching techniques that can capture the overall connectivity and functional groups present in the molecules.

3. **Consider stereochemistry**: Incorporate checks for the stereochemistry of the molecules, especially around the chiral centers in the CoA backbone and the acyl chain.

4. **Consider charge and pH conditions**: Implement checks for the overall charge of the molecule and ensure that it matches the expected charge at pH 7.3. This may involve considering the protonation states of various functional groups.

5. **Incorporate additional structural features**: Look for other structural features that might be characteristic of the class, such as the presence of specific functional groups, chain lengths, or substituents.

6. **Use machine learning techniques**: If the above approaches fail to achieve satisfactory performance, consider using machine learning techniques to learn the patterns and features that distinguish the class from other molecules.
