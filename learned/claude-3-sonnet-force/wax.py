"""
Classifies: CHEBI:73702 wax
"""
After analyzing the previous code and the outcomes, it appears that the program has a relatively high false positive rate, classifying many non-wax compounds as waxes. This could be due to the broad criteria used for identifying waxes, which may not be specific enough to distinguish them from other classes of compounds.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Rotatable bond count**: The threshold of 15 rotatable bonds may be too low. Many non-wax compounds, such as fatty acids, glycerides, and lipids, can also have a high number of rotatable bonds. It might be better to use a higher threshold or combine this criterion with others.

2. **Functional group detection**: The program currently considers the presence of any ester, ether, or alcohol group as a positive indicator for waxes. However, these functional groups are prevalent in many other classes of compounds as well. It might be more specific to look for certain patterns or combinations of these groups that are more characteristic of waxes.

3. **Long carbon chain detection**: The program uses a simple pattern to detect long carbon chains, but this pattern may not be specific enough. It could potentially match cyclic structures or branched chains that are not typical of waxes. More sophisticated methods of chain detection and length calculation might be needed.

4. **Molecular weight**: The molecular weight threshold of 300 Da may be too low. Many waxes, especially those with longer chains or mixtures, can have much higher molecular weights. It might be better to use a higher threshold or combine this criterion with others.

5. **Combination of criteria**: Instead of using each criterion independently, it might be better to combine them in a more sophisticated way. For example, you could require the presence of both long carbon chains and specific functional group patterns, or use a decision tree or machine learning model to combine multiple features.

6. **Handling mixtures**: Waxes are often mixtures of compounds, and the program may struggle to correctly classify these mixtures. Additional logic or preprocessing steps might be needed to handle mixtures effectively.

7. **False negatives**: The program did not have any false negatives in the provided benchmark, but it's worth considering whether the criteria are too strict and might miss some valid wax compounds.

8. **Benchmark quality**: As mentioned, the benchmark data may not be entirely reliable. If the classifications made by the program are consistent with your understanding of the chemical class and the provided examples, you could consider adjusting the criteria or ignoring some of the false positives, but document your reasoning clearly.

To improve the program, you could consider implementing some or all of the following:

- Adjust the thresholds for rotatable bonds, molecular weight, and other numerical criteria based on a more comprehensive analysis of wax structures.
- Use more specific SMARTS patterns or substructure matching to identify characteristic functional group combinations and carbon chain patterns in waxes.
- Combine multiple criteria using decision trees, machine learning models, or other ensemble methods to improve classification accuracy.
- Implement procedures to handle mixtures, such as analyzing individual components or using ensemble methods that can handle mixtures.
- Incorporate additional features or criteria that are specific to waxes, such as melting point ranges, solubility properties, or other physicochemical properties.
- If necessary, adjust the criteria or ignore some false positives based on your expert judgment, but document the reasoning thoroughly.

Additionally, it's always a good practice to test the modified program on a larger and more diverse dataset to ensure its robustness and accuracy.
