"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18133 hexose
"""
The previous program seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues and areas for improvement:

1. **False Positives**: The program is classifying some non-hexose molecules as hexoses. This could be because the current checks are not comprehensive enough. For example, the program is only checking for the presence of an aldehyde or ketone group, but not their position or the arrangement of the carbon chain/ring.

2. **False Negatives**: The program is missing some valid hexose structures. This could be due to the lack of checks for cyclic forms (pyranoses and furanoses) and the specific arrangement of substituents in these ring structures.

3. **Incomplete Cyclic Form Checks**: The program has a placeholder for checking cyclic hexose structures, but this part is not implemented yet.

To improve the program, we can take the following steps:

1. **Improve Linear Form Checks**: Enhance the checks for linear forms by ensuring the aldehyde or ketone group is at the correct position (position 1 for aldohexoses, position 2 for ketohexoses).

2. **Implement Cyclic Form Checks**: Add checks for pyranose and furanose ring structures. This can involve looking for specific SMARTS patterns or analyzing the ring size and arrangement of substituents (e.g., oxygen atoms, hydroxyl groups).

3. **Refine Atom Count Checks**: While the current atom count checks are a good starting point, they may not be sufficient. For example, some non-hexose molecules may have 6 carbon atoms and 4 oxygen atoms but still be classified incorrectly.

4. **Consider Additional Checks**: Depending on the complexity of the problem, additional checks may be needed. For example, checking for specific functional groups or substituents that are characteristic of hexoses.

5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Some molecules may have unusual structures or features that require special handling. It's important to identify and address these edge cases to improve the accuracy of the program.

6. **Analyze False Positives and False Negatives**: Carefully review the false positives and false negatives provided, and use this information to refine the checks and logic in the program.

It's important to note that while the benchmark provided may have occasional mistakes, it can still serve as a valuable guide. However, if you strongly believe that your program's classifications are correct based on your understanding of the chemical class, you can choose to ignore some outliers and provide your reasoning for doing so.
