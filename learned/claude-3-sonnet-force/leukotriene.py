"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25029 leukotriene
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the previous program was too strict in its criteria for classifying a molecule as a leukotriene. The false negatives include several known leukotrienes, indicating that the program is missing some important structural features or arrangements.

Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **Number of double bonds**: The requirement of exactly 4 double bonds seems too strict. Some leukotrienes, like 12-oxo-6-trans-leukotriene B4 and 20-hydroxy-6-trans-leukotriene B4, have more than 4 double bonds due to additional functional groups. It might be better to check for a minimum of 4 double bonds instead of an exact count.

2. **Conjugation of double bonds**: The program checks for the presence of 3 conjugated double bonds, but this might not be a strict requirement for all leukotrienes. Some leukotrienes, like 14,15-dehydro-LTB4, might not have the conjugated double bond pattern but are still considered leukotrienes.

3. **Hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups**: The presence of at least one hydroxy group and one carboxylic acid group seems to be a reasonable requirement, but some leukotrienes, like 20-oxoleukotriene B4, might have a ketone group instead of a carboxylic acid group.

4. **Carbon atom count**: The requirement of exactly 20 carbon atoms might be too strict. Some leukotrienes, like 11,12-dihydro-12-oxoleukotriene C4, have fewer than 20 carbon atoms due to additional functional groups or modifications.

5. **False positives**: The program seems to be too lenient in classifying some molecules as leukotrienes, even though they do not match the structural features of the class. This could be due to the program relying too heavily on specific patterns or functional groups without considering the overall structural context.

To improve the program, you could consider the following:

1. **Relax the double bond count**: Instead of checking for exactly 4 double bonds, check for a minimum of 4 double bonds.

2. **Remove the conjugation check**: The conjugation of double bonds might not be a strict requirement for all leukotrienes, so it might be better to remove this check.

3. **Check for a ketone or carboxylic acid group**: Instead of strictly requiring a carboxylic acid group, check for either a ketone or a carboxylic acid group.

4. **Allow some flexibility in carbon atom count**: Consider allowing a range of carbon atom counts, such as 18 to 22, instead of strictly enforcing 20 carbon atoms.

5. **Improve the overall structural pattern matching**: Instead of relying solely on functional group counts or specific patterns, try to develop a more comprehensive structural pattern that captures the overall arrangement and connectivity of atoms in leukotrienes. This might involve using SMARTS patterns or other advanced RDKit features.

6. **Refine the false positive filtering**: Analyze the false positive cases and try to identify additional structural features or patterns that can be used to exclude these molecules from being classified as leukotrienes.

7. **Consider using machine learning**: If the structural pattern matching approach becomes too complex or fails to provide satisfactory results, you could explore using machine learning techniques, such as training a classifier on a dataset of known leukotrienes and non-leukotrienes.

It's important to note that chemical classification can be a challenging task, and it might not always be possible to achieve perfect accuracy using simple rules or patterns. However, by refining the program based on the observed outcomes and incorporating more structural information, you can likely improve its performance significantly.
