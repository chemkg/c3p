"""
Classifies: CHEBI:50126 tetrasaccharide
"""
After analyzing the previous code and the outcomes, it seems that the code has some issues in correctly identifying tetrasaccharides. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **Ring Size Constraint**: The code assumes that all tetrasaccharides must have four rings of size 5 or 6. However, this assumption may not hold true for all tetrasaccharides. Some tetrasaccharides may have different ring sizes or a combination of different ring sizes. It might be better to relax this constraint or handle exceptions.

2. **Glycosidic Bond Constraint**: The code checks for the presence of at least three glycosidic bonds. While this is a reasonable assumption, there might be cases where the tetrasaccharide has a different number of glycosidic bonds due to its specific structure or the presence of other functional groups.

3. **Carbon and Oxygen Count Ranges**: The code uses predefined ranges for the number of carbon (14-28) and oxygen (8-14) atoms. These ranges may not cover all possible tetrasaccharide structures. It might be better to use broader ranges or find a more robust way to identify the sugar rings.

4. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used (500-1000) may be too narrow and might exclude some valid tetrasaccharides. It would be better to use a broader range or remove this constraint altogether.

5. **False Positives**: Some of the false positives identified by the benchmark seem to be complex molecules with multiple rings, including sugar rings. It might be necessary to add additional checks or constraints to distinguish tetrasaccharides from these complex molecules.

6. **False Negatives**: The false negatives identified by the benchmark include some structures that seem to be valid tetrasaccharides. It might be necessary to relax some of the constraints or handle these cases as exceptions.

Potential improvements:

1. **Use Substructure Matching**: Instead of relying solely on ring counts and atom counts, consider using substructure matching to identify specific sugar ring patterns and their connections. This could improve the accuracy of the classification.

2. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge**: Utilize more chemical knowledge about the specific characteristics of tetrasaccharides, such as common substituents, stereochemistry, and other structural features, to improve the classification logic.

3. **Handle Exceptions**: Identify common exceptions or edge cases that the code might be missing, and handle them appropriately. This could include specific tetrasaccharide structures that don't follow the general rules.

4. **Use Machine Learning**: If the chemical knowledge-based approach becomes too complex, consider using machine learning techniques to learn the patterns of tetrasaccharides from a large dataset of labeled examples.

5. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune the thresholds and ranges used for various constraints based on further analysis of the false positives and false negatives.

It's important to note that the benchmark itself might not be perfect, and some misclassifications could be due to errors in the benchmark data. Therefore, it's crucial to use your chemical knowledge and judgment to assess the reasonableness of the classifications made by your program and make appropriate adjustments if necessary.
