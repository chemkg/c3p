"""
Classifies: CHEBI:72544 flavonoids
"""
It seems the previous program had a few issues, which led to poor performance in classifying flavonoids correctly. Here's my analysis and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Error: `name 'is_flavonoids' is not defined`**
   - The function was named `is_flavonoid` (singular) in the code, but the expected function name was `is_flavonoids` (plural) according to the instructions.
   - Solution: Rename the function to `is_flavonoids`.

2. **Structural patterns used for identification**
   - The SMARTS patterns used to identify flavonoid skeletons (C6-C3-C6, C6-C3-C3, and C6-C3-C6-C3) are too specific and may miss many valid flavonoid structures.
   - The definition mentions that flavonoids include various subclasses like chalcones, dihydrochalcones, aurones, pterocarpans, etc., which may not match the patterns used.
   - Solution: Use a more general pattern or a combination of patterns to cover a wider range of flavonoid structures.

3. **Aromatic ring count**
   - The program checks for condensed systems based on the number of aromatic rings, but this may not be a reliable criterion for identifying flavonoids.
   - Many flavonoids may have fewer than 3 aromatic rings, and some non-flavonoids may have 3 or more aromatic rings.
   - Solution: Remove or modify this check, as it may not be a reliable indicator of flavonoid structures.

4. **Molecular weight check**
   - The molecular weight range of 200-800 Da may be too narrow for flavonoids, especially for oligomers or derivatives with large substituents.
   - Solution: Expand the molecular weight range or remove this check if it is not a reliable indicator.

5. **Oxygen atom count**
   - The check for a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms may be too restrictive, as some flavonoids may have fewer oxygen atoms or none at all.
   - Solution: Remove or modify this check, as it may not be a reliable indicator of flavonoid structures.

6. **Additional checks**
   - The program could benefit from additional checks or features to better identify flavonoid structures, such as:
     - Checking for specific substructures or functional groups common in flavonoids (e.g., phenolic groups, carbonyl groups, etc.).
     - Considering the presence of substituents like hydroxyl, methoxy, prenyl, or sugar moieties, which are common in flavonoids.
     - Checking for specific molecular scaffolds or skeletons characteristic of different flavonoid subclasses.
     - Using machine learning models trained on flavonoid structures to improve classification accuracy.

By addressing these issues and incorporating additional checks or features, the program's performance in classifying flavonoids could potentially improve significantly.
