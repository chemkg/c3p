"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18254 ribonucleoside
"""
Reasoning:

The previous program attempts to classify a molecule as a ribonucleoside by checking for the presence of three key components: a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a glycosidic bond connecting the two. However, based on the provided outcomes, it appears that the program is being overly strict in its criteria, resulting in many false negatives.

Here are some potential issues and ways to improve the program:

1. The program assumes that all ribonucleosides have a nucleobase containing nitrogen atoms (the `nuc_base_pattern` SMARTS pattern). However, there are some ribonucleosides with modified or non-standard nucleobases that may not match this pattern. For example, the provided outcome for "5-aminoimidazole ribonucleoside" (SMILES: `O1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]1N2C(=CN=C2)N)O)O)CO`) does not contain a traditional nucleobase with nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings.

2. The program's ribose pattern (`[C@H]1([C@@H](CO)O[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O)O`) is very specific and may not match ribose sugars with different conformations or substitutions. For example, the provided outcome for "9-ribosyl-cis-zeatin" (SMILES: `C\C(CO)=C\CNc1ncnc2n(cnc12)[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O`) contains a ribose sugar with a different conformation than the pattern expects.

3. The program checks for the presence of a glycosidic bond by looking for a bond between the ribose sugar and a nitrogen atom in the nucleobase. However, some ribonucleosides may have different types of glycosidic bonds or alternative linkages between the sugar and the base. For example, the provided outcome for "7-methylxanthosine" (SMILES: `C[n+]1cn([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)c2[nH]c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c12`) has a glycosidic bond between the ribose and a carbon atom in the nucleobase.

To improve the program and reduce false negatives, you could consider the following modifications:

1. Use a more general SMARTS pattern for the nucleobase component, or consider alternative approaches like checking for aromatic rings or specific functional groups that are common in nucleobases.

2. Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern for the ribose sugar component, or consider alternative approaches like checking for the presence of a 5-membered ring with specific substituents and stereochemistry.

3. Instead of checking for a specific type of glycosidic bond, you could check for the presence of any bond between the ribose sugar and the nucleobase component, regardless of the atom types involved.

Additionally, you could consider incorporating other checks or heuristics to improve the classification accuracy, such as molecular weight ranges, atom count ranges, or specific functional group patterns that are characteristic of ribonucleosides.

Here's an updated program that incorporates some of these improvements:
