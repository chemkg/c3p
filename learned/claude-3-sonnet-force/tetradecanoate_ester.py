"""
Classifies: CHEBI:87691 tetradecanoate ester
"""
The previous program aimed to classify molecules as tetradecanoate esters based on the presence of the tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid) fragment and its esterification to an alcohol or phenol. While the program correctly identified some examples, there were some false positives and false negatives, indicating room for improvement.

Analysis of False Positives:
The false positives mainly arise from two issues:

1. The program only checks for the presence of a tetradecanoic acid fragment and an ester bond, but does not verify if the ester bond is specifically between the tetradecanoic acid and an alcohol or phenol. This means that molecules with other carboxylic acids esterified are also classified as tetradecanoate esters.

2. The program does not consider the possibility of multiple ester groups or multiple tetradecanoic acid fragments in the same molecule. If a molecule has multiple ester groups, it may be incorrectly classified as a tetradecanoate ester.

Analysis of False Negatives:
The false negatives stem from the program's strict requirement of having at least three oxygen atoms for a tetradecanoate ester. While most tetradecanoate esters will have three or more oxygen atoms (one in the carboxyl group, one in the ester bond, and one in the alcohol/phenol), there can be exceptions where the alcohol/phenol has no additional oxygen atoms. The program missed these cases.

Improvements:
To address the false positives, the program should:

1. Verify that the ester bond is specifically between the tetradecanoic acid fragment and an alcohol or phenol group. This can be done by checking the neighboring atoms around the ester bond for specific patterns.

2. Handle cases where there are multiple ester groups or multiple tetradecanoic acid fragments in the same molecule. The program should ensure that at least one tetradecanoic acid fragment is esterified to an alcohol or phenol, and not just the presence of these fragments independently.

To address the false negatives, the program should:

1. Relax the requirement for a minimum number of oxygen atoms, as there can be valid tetradecanoate esters with fewer than three oxygen atoms (e.g., when the alcohol/phenol has no additional oxygen atoms).

Additionally, the program could include additional checks or heuristics to improve classification accuracy, such as considering molecular weight, presence of long alkyl chains (for fatty acid chains), or other structural features specific to tetradecanoate esters.

It's important to note that while the benchmark may contain some mistakes, the reasoning provided here is based on a general understanding of chemical structures and the definition of tetradecanoate esters. If the classifications made by the program align with this understanding, it may be reasonable to ignore some outliers in the benchmark, provided the reasoning is well-justified.
