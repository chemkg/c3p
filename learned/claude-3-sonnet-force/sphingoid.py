"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35785 sphingoid
"""
The previous program has a good overall approach to classifying sphingoids, but it misses some key structural features and edge cases. Here's an analysis of the outcomes and potential improvements:

True Positives:
The program correctly identified 42 out of 42 true sphingoids in the dataset. This is a good sign that the core logic is sound.

False Positives:
There was only 1 false positive, which is a low number. However, it's worth investigating to ensure that the program is not missing any important structural features.

False Negatives:
All 42 true sphingoids were correctly identified, so there are no false negatives. However, there are some SMILES strings for which the program failed to provide a reason for classification, indicating potential issues.

Analysis of SMILES strings without a reason:
1. N-(2-hydroxynonadecanoyl)-1-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecasphinganine
   - This is a sphingoid with a glucosyl group attached. The program should be extended to handle such modifications.

2. N-(2-hydroxypentacosanoyl)-1-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecasphinganine
   - Another sphingoid with a glucosyl group. Same issue as above.

3. N-(2-hydroxytetracosanoyl)-4-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecasphinganine-1-phosphocholine
   - This is a sphingoid with a phosphocholine group attached. The program should be extended to handle such modifications.

4. N-(2-hydroxyhenicosanoyl)-1-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecasphinganine
   - Another sphingoid with a glucosyl group. Same issue as above.

5. tetradecaphytosphingosine
   - This is a valid sphingoid, but the program missed it because the backbone pattern is slightly different (missing the terminal -CH2OH group).

6. hexadecasphinganine(1+)
   - This is a valid sphingoid in a protonated form. The program should be extended to handle charged species.

7. 3-dehydro-15-methylhexadecasphinganine
   - This is a valid unsaturated sphingoid. The program should be extended to handle unsaturated backbones better.

8. aplidiasphingosine
   - This is a valid sphingoid with a branched alkyl chain. The program should be extended to handle branched chains.

9. 1-deoxymethyl-3-dehydrosphinganine
   - This is a valid unsaturated sphingoid with a slightly modified backbone. The program should be extended to handle such modifications.

10. hexadecasphing-4-enine
    - This is a valid unsaturated sphingoid. The program should be extended to handle unsaturated backbones better.

Potential Improvements:
1. Extend the backbone pattern to handle modifications such as glucosyl groups, phosphocholine groups, and other common modifications.
2. Extend the backbone pattern to handle charged species (e.g., protonated forms).
3. Improve handling of unsaturated backbones by checking for specific unsaturation patterns or using a more flexible SMARTS pattern.
4. Handle branched alkyl chains in addition to linear chains.
5. Consider additional checks for molecular weight, atom counts, or other properties to further refine the classification.

Overall, the program has a good foundation, but it would benefit from additional refinements to handle a wider range of sphingoid structures and modifications. By addressing the issues identified in the false negatives and missed cases, the program's accuracy and coverage can be significantly improved.
