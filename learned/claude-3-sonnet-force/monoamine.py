"""
Classifies: CHEBI:63534 monoamine
"""
The previous program attempted to identify monoamines by checking for the presence of an aromatic ring, an amino group, and verifying that the amino group is connected to the aromatic ring via a two-carbon chain. However, the program failed to classify any molecules correctly, suggesting that there are issues with the approach.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and improvements that could be made:

1. **The FindAllPathsOfLengthN function is not being used correctly**: The error message indicates that the arguments passed to the `FindAllPathsOfLengthN` function do not match the expected signature. This function is likely the root cause of the failure, as it is responsible for finding the path between the amino group and the aromatic ring.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function is called with the correct arguments and types. Consulting the RDKit documentation for the `FindAllPathsOfLengthN` function would be helpful to understand the expected argument types and their meanings.

2. **The SMARTS patterns may be too specific or incorrect**: The program uses SMARTS patterns to identify the aromatic ring and amino group. However, these patterns may be too specific or incorrect, leading to missed matches or incorrect matches.

One approach to improve this aspect could be to analyze the SMARTS patterns used and compare them with the examples provided. Additionally, it might be beneficial to use more general patterns or a combination of patterns to increase the likelihood of correctly identifying the desired substructures.

3. **The definition of a monoamine may be incomplete or too strict**: The program's definition of a monoamine focuses solely on the presence of an aromatic ring, an amino group, and a two-carbon chain connecting them. However, the definition provided in the problem statement also mentions that monoamines are derived from aromatic amino acids and are related to thyroid hormones.

To address this, the program could incorporate additional checks or rules to ensure that the identified molecules conform to the broader definition of monoamines. This could involve checking for the presence of specific functional groups, substituents, or even considering the overall molecular structure and properties.

4. **Handling stereochemistry and isomerism**: The provided examples include molecules with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (R)- and (S)-isomers). The current program does not consider stereochemistry, which could lead to incorrect classifications.

To account for stereochemistry, the program might need to incorporate additional checks or use specialized functions from RDKit to handle stereochemical information accurately.

5. **Considering alternative approaches**: If the above improvements still fail to yield satisfactory results, it might be worth considering alternative approaches to classifying monoamines. For example, machine learning techniques or rule-based systems that leverage a broader set of molecular descriptors could potentially provide better classification accuracy.

Based on the outcomes and the potential issues identified, it would be beneficial to revisit the program's implementation, consult the RDKit documentation thoroughly, and potentially explore alternative approaches to classifying monoamines effectively.

It's important to note that the provided benchmark may not be perfect, and there could be occasional or systematic mistakes. In such cases, relying on your understanding of chemistry and the definition of monoamines would be prudent, and if the classifications made by your program align with your understanding, you could justify ignoring outliers while providing a clear explanation for your reasoning.
