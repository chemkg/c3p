"""
Classifies: CHEBI:20156 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid
"""
The previous code attempted to classify 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroids based on several structural features:

1. It checked for the presence of a steroid backbone using a SMARTS pattern.
2. It checked for the presence of a single oxo group (=O).
3. It verified that the oxo group was part of the steroid ring system.
4. It checked for the presence of a single double bond.
5. It verified that the double bond was part of the steroid ring system.

However, this approach has some limitations that may have caused the low performance:

1. **Steroid backbone pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used to identify the steroid backbone is very specific and may not capture all possible variations in the steroid core structure. Steroids can have different substituents, unsaturations, and ring fusions that are not accounted for in the pattern.

2. **Oxo group position**: The code checks that the oxo group is part of the ring system, but it does not explicitly ensure that the oxo group is at the 3-position, which is a requirement for the 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid class.

3. **Double bond position**: While the code checks that the double bond is part of the ring system, it does not explicitly ensure that the double bond is between positions 1 and 2, which is a requirement for the Delta(1) designation.

4. **Additional structural features**: The code does not account for other structural features that may be relevant for this class, such as the presence of specific substituents or the absence of certain functional groups.

To improve the program, we can consider the following changes:

1. **Use a more general steroid backbone pattern**: Instead of relying on a highly specific SMARTS pattern, we can use a more general pattern that captures the core steroid structure, potentially with some additional constraints to ensure specific ring fusions or unsaturations.

2. **Explicitly check the position of the oxo group and double bond**: We can use additional SMARTS patterns or atom mapping techniques to ensure that the oxo group is at the 3-position and the double bond is between positions 1 and 2.

3. **Consider additional structural features**: Analyze the examples provided and identify any additional structural features that are consistently present or absent in the 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid class. We can then incorporate checks for these features in the program.

4. **Use machine learning techniques**: If the structural features are complex and difficult to encode with SMARTS patterns, we could consider using machine learning techniques to learn the patterns from the provided examples.

By addressing these limitations and incorporating additional structural constraints, we may be able to improve the performance of the program in classifying 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroids.
