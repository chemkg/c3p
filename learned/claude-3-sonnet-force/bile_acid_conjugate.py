"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36249 bile acid conjugate
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, I believe the issue lies in the bile acid backbone pattern used for matching. The provided pattern seems too specific and may not cover all possible bile acid backbone structures.

Additionally, the conjugation patterns could be improved to cover a broader range of conjugation groups. For example, the amino acid pattern only considers primary and secondary amines, but not tertiary amines. The glucuronic acid pattern is also very specific and may not match all possible glucuronic acid derivatives.

To improve the program, we can follow these steps:

1. Use a more generalized bile acid backbone pattern that captures the core steroid structure without being too specific about substituents or stereochemistry.
2. Expand the list of conjugation patterns to include additional functional groups and variations, such as different amino acids, sulfate esters, and glucuronide derivatives.
3. Consider incorporating additional checks or filters to further validate the identified bile acid conjugates, such as molecular weight, ring count, or specific functional group counts.

By taking these steps, we can create a more robust and comprehensive program for classifying bile acid conjugates.

It's important to note that while the provided benchmark may not be perfect, it can still serve as a valuable guide. If the program's classifications align with your understanding of the chemical class, you can trust your chemical knowledge and adjust the program accordingly, even if it means ignoring some potential outliers in the benchmark.
