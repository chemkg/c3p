"""
Classifies: CHEBI:83820 non-proteinogenic amino acid
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it seems that the approach of checking for the presence of one carboxyl and one amino group, and then excluding proteinogenic amino acids, is too simplistic and results in many false positives and false negatives.

False positives:
The program incorrectly classified many non-amino acid molecules as non-proteinogenic amino acids because they contained one carboxyl and one amino group, but did not satisfy other structural requirements for amino acids. Examples include various drug molecules, intermediates, and byproducts.

False negatives:
The program missed many valid non-proteinogenic amino acids because they did not strictly follow the pattern of having one carboxyl and one amino group. Examples include amino acids with modified backbones, additional functional groups, or unusual side chains.

To improve the program, we need a more sophisticated approach that considers the overall structural features of amino acids, rather than just counting specific functional groups. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more comprehensive SMARTS pattern or substructure matching to identify the core amino acid backbone structure (alpha-carbon with amino and carboxyl groups).

2. Allow for additional functional groups or modifications on the amino acid backbone, but still enforce the core structural requirements.

3. Use machine learning techniques or expert-curated rules to identify non-proteinogenic amino acids based on their structural features, rather than relying solely on substructure matching.

4. Incorporate additional checks or filters, such as molecular weight, atom counts, or other molecular descriptors, to further refine the classification.

5. Consider using a curated database or list of known non-proteinogenic amino acids as a reference, rather than relying solely on the exclusion of proteinogenic amino acids.

6. Analyze the false positives and false negatives to identify systematic issues or patterns that can be addressed through refinements to the program logic or additional checks.

It's important to note that the classification of non-proteinogenic amino acids can be challenging, as there can be ambiguities or borderline cases. Therefore, it may be necessary to make reasonable assumptions or simplifications, and to clearly document the limitations of the program.

In summary, while the previous program had the right idea of using SMARTS patterns and substructure matching, it was too simplistic and missed many valid non-proteinogenic amino acids while also incorrectly classifying many non-amino acid molecules. A more sophisticated approach that considers the overall structural features and incorporates additional checks or machine learning techniques is likely required to improve the accuracy of the classification.
