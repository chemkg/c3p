"""
Classifies: CHEBI:36615 triterpenoid
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the previous program had a few key issues:

1. **Over-reliance on the C30 skeleton**: While the C30 skeleton is a defining feature of triterpenoids, the program was too strict in requiring an exact count of 30 carbon atoms. Many triterpenoids can have modifications or rearrangements that alter the carbon count, as mentioned in the definition. Examples like fatsicarpain F (31 carbons) and Bauerenyl acetate (32 carbons) were incorrectly classified as non-triterpenoids due to this restriction.

2. **Limited set of reference skeletons**: The program only checked for a few common triterpenoid skeletons (lanostane, cycloartane, and friedelane). While these are indeed prevalent skeletons, triterpenoids can have a wide variety of rearranged and modified skeletons that were not accounted for in the program.

3. **Ineffective handling of rearranged/modified skeletons**: The program attempted to account for rearranged/modified skeletons by using a broad SMARTS pattern based on the three reference skeletons. However, this approach was likely too broad and may have resulted in false positives or missed cases where the modifications were more substantial.

To improve the program, we can consider the following changes:

1. **Relax the strict carbon count requirement**: Instead of requiring an exact count of 30 carbons, we could allow for a range of carbon counts (e.g., 28-32) to accommodate common modifications and rearrangements.

2. **Expand the set of reference skeletons**: While it is challenging to enumerate all possible triterpenoid skeletons, we could include a more comprehensive set of common skeletons based on literature or databases like PubChem.

3. **Refine the approach for handling rearranged/modified skeletons**: Instead of using a broad SMARTS pattern, we could investigate more targeted approaches, such as:
   - Develop SMARTS patterns for specific types of modifications (e.g., removal of methyl groups, rearrangement of ring systems, etc.)
   - Use machine learning techniques to identify structural patterns in known triterpenoids and generalize to new molecules.
   - Leverage existing databases or literature to curate a set of known triterpenoid scaffolds and check for substructure matches.

4. **Incorporate additional structural features**: While the skeleton is a key feature, we could also consider incorporating other structural features commonly found in triterpenoids, such as the presence of oxygenated functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters) or specific ring systems.

5. **Handle borderline cases**: As mentioned in the problem statement, some molecules may be classified as triterpenoids even if they do not strictly adhere to the definition. In such cases, it may be useful to provide a more nuanced classification or a confidence score, rather than a binary yes/no answer.

It's important to note that while the benchmark provided may have some inconsistencies, the examples flagged as "MISSED" seem to be reasonable triterpenoid structures based on their skeletons and modifications. Therefore, it would be valuable to incorporate these examples into the training or validation set for improving the program's performance.
