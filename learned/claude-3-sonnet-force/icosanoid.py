"""
Classifies: CHEBI:23899 icosanoid
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the current program has some issues in accurately classifying icosanoids. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **False Negatives**: Several molecules that are listed as examples of icosanoids are being incorrectly classified as non-icosanoids by the program. This suggests that the current criteria used for classification may be too strict or incomplete.

2. **Cyclopentane/Cyclopentene Ring**: The requirement for a cyclopentane or cyclopentene ring seems to be the reason for some false negatives, such as "19R-Hydroxy-PGE2" and "delta(17)-6-keto Prostaglandin F1alpha". While many icosanoids contain these rings, it might be too restrictive to require them for all icosanoids.

3. **Carbon Count**: The requirement for exactly 20 carbon atoms is also causing some false negatives, like "1-Glyceryl-PGE2" and "PG(PGE2/i-14:0)". Some icosanoids might have slightly fewer or more than 20 carbons due to modifications or substituents.

4. **Double Bond Count**: The requirement for at least 3 carbon-carbon double bonds might also be too strict, as some icosanoids may have fewer double bonds or different types of unsaturation.

5. **Oxygen Atom Count**: The minimum requirement of 3 oxygen atoms may exclude some valid icosanoids with fewer oxygen atoms.

To improve the program, we could consider the following modifications:

1. Relax the strict requirements for a cyclopentane/cyclopentene ring, exactly 20 carbon atoms, and a minimum number of double bonds or oxygen atoms. Instead, we could look for the presence of these features without strict counts or requirements.

2. Introduce additional structural patterns or substructures that are commonly found in icosanoids, such as specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones) or carbon chain lengths.

3. Consider using machine learning or statistical models trained on a larger dataset of known icosanoids to learn the structural patterns more effectively.

4. If there are specific outliers or exceptions that are consistently misclassified, we could incorporate rules or exceptions to handle them separately.

5. Consult with domain experts or literature to refine the definition and criteria for classifying icosanoids, as there may be nuances or variations not captured by the current program.

Overall, while the current program captures some key features of icosanoids, it may benefit from a more flexible and comprehensive approach to handle the structural diversity within this class of molecules.
