"""
Classifies: CHEBI:15841 polypeptide
"""
The previous code attempts to classify a molecule as a polypeptide by checking for the presence of a peptide backbone and counting the number of amino acid residues. However, the outcomes indicate that this approach has some limitations, as it failed to correctly classify several known polypeptide examples.

Here are some potential issues and improvements:

1. **Missed modifications and cyclizations**: The current approach only looks for a linear peptide backbone and does not account for modifications, such as N-terminal acetylation, C-terminal amidation, or cyclizations. Many examples, like curvopeptin-6 and scytocyclamide B, are cyclic peptides, which were missed by the current implementation.

   *Improvement*: Modify the SMARTS patterns to account for common modifications and cyclizations in polypeptides.

2. **Strict residue counting**: The code requires at least 10 amino acid residues to classify a molecule as a polypeptide. However, some smaller peptides, like dermaseptin s3(1-16)-NH2 with 16 residues, were incorrectly classified as false negatives.

   *Improvement*: Consider relaxing the residue count threshold or incorporating additional checks to handle smaller polypeptides.

3. **Incomplete SMARTS pattern**: The current SMARTS pattern for the peptide backbone only captures a specific arrangement of atoms and bonds. Some polypeptide examples, like Lyngbyazothrin A and Tridecaptin A1, have more complex structures that may not match the pattern.

   *Improvement*: Enhance the SMARTS pattern to capture a broader range of polypeptide structures, including branched or cyclized backbones.

4. **Lack of context**: The current approach solely relies on the presence of a peptide backbone and residue count, without considering the overall molecular context or structural features. This can lead to false positives for non-polypeptide molecules that happen to contain a substructure matching the pattern.

   *Improvement*: Incorporate additional checks or heuristics to filter out false positives, such as molecular weight, atom count, or specific functional group patterns.

5. **Handling complex structures**: Some of the false negative examples, like the long SMILES string starting with "O=C(O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)CNC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C1N(C(=O)C(C(=O)CCCCCCCCCCC)C)CCC1)(C)C)(C)C)(C)C)C)(C)C)C)C(C)C)(C)C)CCCN=C(N)N)C)(C)C)(C)C)(C)C)C)C)(C)C", represent extremely complex polypeptide structures that may require more sophisticated pattern matching or structural analysis.

   *Improvement*: Consider breaking down the analysis into smaller substructures or employing more advanced techniques, such as graph-based pattern matching or machine learning models trained on polypeptide structures.

While addressing these issues can improve the classification performance, it's important to note that polypeptide structures can be highly diverse and complex, making it challenging to capture all possible cases with a rule-based approach. In some scenarios, it may be necessary to combine multiple techniques or rely on more advanced methods, such as machine learning models trained on polypeptide data.
