"""
Classifies: CHEBI:35359 carboxamidine
"""
The previous program seems to have a few issues that led to the poor performance. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Missed cases**: The program missed several positive cases where the molecule contained the carboxamidine group. This could be due to the SMARTS pattern used to match the carboxamidine group being too specific or not accounting for different representations of the same functional group.

2. **False positives**: The program classified some molecules as carboxamidines even though they did not contain the specific `RC(=NR)NR2` structure required for a carboxamidine. This could be because the program was looking for the presence of the `-C(=N)-N` amidine group, which is a substructure of the carboxamidine group, but not necessarily a carboxamidine itself.

3. **Handling aromatic rings**: The previous program did not account for the possibility of the carboxamidine group being part of an aromatic ring system. This could be a limitation since some carboxamidine-containing molecules may have the functional group embedded in an aromatic ring.

4. **Handling different representations**: The program might not be able to handle different representations of the same functional group, such as tautomers or resonance structures. For example, the carboxamidine group could be represented as `-C(=NH)-NH2` or `-C(=N-)-NH2`, depending on the representation.

To improve the program, we could consider the following:

1. **Modify the SMARTS pattern**: Instead of using separate patterns for the amidine group and the carboxamidine group, we could use a single, more comprehensive SMARTS pattern that matches the complete `RC(=NR)NR2` structure. This would help capture all instances of the carboxamidine group, including those in aromatic rings or different representations.

2. **Handle tautomers and resonance structures**: We could use RDKit's built-in functions to generate tautomers and resonance structures of the input molecule, and then check if any of these structures contain the carboxamidine group. This would help identify carboxamidines even if they are represented in a different but equivalent form.

3. **Consider additional filters**: We could add additional filters to ensure that the matched substructure is indeed a carboxamidine group and not just a similar-looking fragment. For example, we could check the atom connectivity, hybridization states, or other molecular properties to filter out false positives.

4. **Incorporate machine learning**: If the rule-based approach continues to struggle, we could consider training a machine learning model to classify molecules as carboxamidines or not, based on their structural features or molecular fingerprints. This could potentially improve the accuracy, but would require a labeled dataset for training and validation.

By addressing these issues, we may be able to create a more robust and accurate program for classifying carboxamidine compounds based on their SMILES strings.
