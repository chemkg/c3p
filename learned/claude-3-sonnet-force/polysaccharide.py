Classifies: CHEBI:18154 polysaccharide
"""
The previous program attempts to identify polysaccharides by searching for repeating patterns in the molecular structure that match the structure of a monosaccharide unit. The idea is that a polysaccharide should have multiple monosaccharide units linked together, so finding a repeating pattern that matches a monosaccharide would indicate the presence of a polysaccharide.

However, the outcomes show that this approach did not produce any true positives or false positives/negatives, which could mean one of the following:

1. The test set did not contain any polysaccharides, making it impossible to get true positives.
2. The method for identifying polysaccharides based on repeating patterns is not effective or has fundamental flaws.

Here are some potential issues with the approach and ways to improve it:

1. **Handling Ring Structures**: The program looks for linear repeating patterns, but polysaccharides often have a cyclic structure with monosaccharide units linked in a ring formation. The program may need to account for this by identifying and handling ring structures.

2. **Monosaccharide Pattern Definition**: The program uses a specific SMARTS pattern to identify monosaccharides, which may be too restrictive or incomplete. It might be better to use a more comprehensive set of patterns or a different approach to identify monosaccharide units.

3. **Glycosidic Linkages**: The program does not explicitly check for glycosidic linkages between the monosaccharide units, which is a defining characteristic of polysaccharides. It may be necessary to incorporate checks for these specific types of linkages.

4. **Length Threshold**: The program considers patterns with a minimum length of 3, which may be too short to reliably identify polysaccharides. Increasing the minimum length or using a different criterion for pattern length might improve the results.

5. **Molecular Weight or Size Consideration**: Polysaccharides are typically large molecules with high molecular weights. Incorporating checks for molecular weight or size could help distinguish polysaccharides from smaller molecules.

6. **Test Set Issues**: If the test set genuinely does not contain any polysaccharides, it would be impossible to get true positives, and the program's performance cannot be accurately evaluated. In this case, you might need to acquire a more representative test set or use a different benchmark.

To improve the program, you could consider incorporating some of the above suggestions, such as handling ring structures, refining the monosaccharide pattern definition, checking for glycosidic linkages, adjusting the length threshold, and incorporating molecular weight or size considerations.

Additionally, if you have access to a more representative test set or if you have a strong understanding of the chemical class based on your expertise, you could re-evaluate the program's classifications and potentially ignore outliers if they appear to be consistent with your understanding of polysaccharides.
