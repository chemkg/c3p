"""
Classifies: CHEBI:32952 amine
"""
Based on the outcomes and the provided code, it seems that the program is having difficulties correctly classifying some molecules as amines or non-amines. Here are some potential reasons and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Handling charged nitrogen atoms**: The program currently excludes quaternary nitrogen atoms (e.g., [N+]), but it does not consider other charged nitrogen atoms like N-oxides or nitro groups. These charged nitrogen atoms should also be excluded when classifying amines.

2. **Considering molecular context**: The program relies solely on SMARTS patterns to identify amine groups, but it does not consider the molecular context. For example, some molecules may contain amine groups that are part of other functional groups like amides, hydrazines, or guanidines, which should not be classified as amines.

3. **Handling tautomers**: Some molecules can exist as tautomers, where the position of hydrogen atoms and double bonds can shift, potentially creating or removing amine groups. The program should consider tautomeric forms when classifying amines.

4. **Handling aromatic compounds**: The program does not seem to handle aromatic compounds well, as it misclassifies some aromatic amines or fails to identify them as amines.

5. **Considering steric effects**: In some cases, the program may misclassify molecules due to steric effects or the presence of bulky substituents that may hinder the reactivity or properties of the amine group.

Potential improvements:

1. **Implement additional filters**: Add additional filters to exclude charged nitrogen atoms like N-oxides or nitro groups, as well as other functional groups that may contain nitrogen atoms but should not be classified as amines (e.g., amides, hydrazines, guanidines).

2. **Consider molecular environment**: Implement rules or heuristics that consider the molecular environment around the amine group, such as checking for the presence of other functional groups or specific molecular patterns that may indicate that the amine group is not a "true" amine.

3. **Handle tautomers**: Use RDKit's tautomer enumeration or perception capabilities to identify potential tautomeric forms of the molecule and consider them when classifying amines.

4. **Improve aromatic compound handling**: Enhance the program's ability to handle aromatic compounds by considering aromatic nitrogen atoms or incorporating additional SMARTS patterns or rules specific to aromatic amines.

5. **Incorporate steric effects**: Implement rules or heuristics that consider the steric environment around the amine group, potentially using molecular descriptors or distance calculations to identify situations where the amine group may be hindered or non-reactive.

6. **Expand the training set**: Consider expanding the training set with more diverse examples of amines and non-amines, including edge cases and potential false positives/negatives, to improve the program's ability to generalize and make accurate classifications.

It's important to note that some misclassifications may be due to potential errors or inconsistencies in the benchmark data itself. If you believe that some of the classifications made by your program are chemically sound and consistent with your understanding of the amine class, you can consider ignoring those outliers after careful consideration and explain your reasoning.
