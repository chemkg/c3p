"""
Classifies: CHEBI:26935 tetraterpenoid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as tetraterpenoids based on the following criteria:

1. The molecule must have a C40 skeleton (40 carbon atoms).
2. The molecule must contain terpenoid-like isoprene units.
3. If the molecule contains a rearranged or modified tetraterpene skeleton, it should have a large aliphatic ring (more than 6 atoms).

However, based on the provided outcomes, the program appears to have some limitations and potential issues:

1. **Handling of modified tetraterpene skeletons**: The program correctly identifies that tetraterpenoids can have modified or rearranged C40 skeletons, but it only checks for the presence of a large aliphatic ring as an indicator of this. This approach may be too simplistic, as there could be other ways in which the C40 skeleton is modified, leading to false negatives.

2. **Handling of glycosides and other derivatives**: Some of the false negatives, such as "Zeaxanthin diglucoside" and "Astaxanthin diglucoside," are glycosides of tetraterpenoids. The program does not account for these types of derivatives, where additional atoms (e.g., sugar units) are attached to the core tetraterpene structure, leading to a higher carbon count.

3. **Reliance on isoprene units**: The program relies on the presence of terpenoid-like isoprene units as a key indicator of tetraterpenoids. While this is a reasonable assumption, it may not hold true for all tetraterpenoids, especially those with highly rearranged or modified structures.

To improve the program, the following steps could be considered:

1. **Incorporate more flexible skeleton matching**: Instead of relying solely on the carbon count and the presence of a large aliphatic ring, the program could attempt to match the core tetraterpene skeleton more flexibly. This could involve using more advanced substructure matching techniques or machine learning models trained on known tetraterpenoid structures.

2. **Handle derivatives and modifications**: The program should be able to handle common derivatives and modifications of tetraterpenoids, such as glycosides, esters, and other functional group substitutions. This could involve identifying common substitution patterns or incorporating additional rules or heuristics.

3. **Utilize additional structural features**: In addition to the presence of isoprene units, the program could consider other structural features that are characteristic of tetraterpenoids, such as conjugated double bond systems, cyclization patterns, or specific functional groups.

4. **Incorporate domain knowledge and expert curation**: Given the complexity of the task and the potential for edge cases, it may be beneficial to incorporate domain knowledge from experts in the field of terpenoid chemistry. This could involve curating a set of known tetraterpenoid structures and using them to train or refine the classification model.

5. **Explore machine learning approaches**: If a sufficiently large and curated dataset of tetraterpenoid structures is available, machine learning approaches such as supervised learning or transfer learning could be explored. These techniques could potentially learn more complex patterns and features relevant to tetraterpenoid classification.

It's important to note that chemical classification tasks can be challenging, and there may not be a single, perfect solution that works for all cases. In this specific case, it may be necessary to accept a certain level of inaccuracy or false positives/negatives, particularly for edge cases or highly modified structures. Additionally, incorporating expert knowledge and domain-specific heuristics may be crucial for achieving satisfactory performance.
