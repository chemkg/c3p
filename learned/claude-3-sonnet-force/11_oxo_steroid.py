"""
Classifies: CHEBI:47787 11-oxo steroid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify 11-oxo steroids by checking for a steroid backbone and the presence of an oxo group at position 11. However, the outcomes indicate that it failed to correctly identify several known examples of 11-oxo steroids, classifying them as false negatives.

Here are some potential reasons for the failure and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Steroid Backbone Pattern**:
   The steroid backbone pattern used in the program may be too specific and rigid, failing to match some valid steroid structures. Steroids can have diverse ring conformations and substituents, making it challenging to capture all possibilities with a single SMARTS pattern.

   Potential improvement: Consider using a more flexible and general pattern for the steroid backbone, or a combination of patterns to cover a broader range of structures.

2. **Position 11 Oxo Group Pattern**:
   Similarly, the pattern used to detect the oxo group at position 11 may be too restrictive, missing some valid conformations or substituents.

   Potential improvement: Explore alternative patterns or a combination of patterns to better capture the oxo group at position 11 in diverse steroid structures.

3. **Molecular Weight and Atom Count Filters**:
   The filters based on molecular weight and atom counts may be too narrow, excluding some valid 11-oxo steroid structures.

   Potential improvement: Reevaluate the ranges for molecular weight and atom counts based on a broader set of examples, or consider removing these filters if they are too restrictive.

4. **Additional Structural Features**:
   The program may need to consider additional structural features or constraints specific to 11-oxo steroids, such as ring fusions, stereochemistry, or the presence of other functional groups.

   Potential improvement: Analyze the false negatives and identify common structural features or patterns that distinguish 11-oxo steroids from other steroid classes. Incorporate these features into the classification logic.

5. **Benchmark Data Quality**:
   As mentioned, there may be occasional or systematic mistakes in the benchmark data, leading to incorrect classifications being considered false negatives.

   Potential improvement: Carefully review the false negatives and, if you are confident that your program is correctly classifying them as 11-oxo steroids based on your understanding of the chemical class, you can consider ignoring these outliers and providing a justification for your decision.

Given the complexity of the 11-oxo steroid class and the potential limitations of the benchmark data, it may be beneficial to take an iterative approach. Start with a more general and flexible set of patterns and filters, and gradually refine them based on the outcomes and your chemical knowledge. Additionally, consulting relevant literature or databases for comprehensive structural patterns or examples of 11-oxo steroids can be helpful.

Remember, the goal is to develop a program that aligns with your understanding of the chemical class while balancing the need for accurate classification and robustness to diverse structural variations.
