"""
Classifies: CHEBI:78608 alpha-amino-acid zwitterion
"""
The previous program was focused on identifying the zwitterionic NH3+/COO- pattern and ensuring that the alpha carbon was singly substituted (excluding NH3+ and COO-). However, it appears that this approach is too narrow and misses some valid alpha-amino-acid zwitterion structures.

Here are a few potential issues and improvements:

1. **Handling variations in the zwitterionic pattern**: The program currently looks for a specific SMARTS pattern ([NH3+][CX3](C([O-])=O)[H]) for the zwitterionic group. However, this pattern may not capture all possible variations, such as different formal charges or bond orders. It might be better to look for the presence of an NH3+ group and a COO- group separately, and then check their connectivity.

2. **Handling ring structures**: The current program does not account for alpha-amino-acids that are part of a ring structure, such as proline derivatives. These structures may not match the linear SMARTS pattern used.

3. **Handling additional substituents on alpha carbon**: The program currently assumes that the alpha carbon should have only one substituent (excluding NH3+ and COO-). However, some of the false negatives in the outcomes list have additional substituents on the alpha carbon, such as sulfur-containing groups or hydroxyl groups.

4. **Handling charges and formal charges**: The program may benefit from a more robust handling of charges and formal charges, as some of the false negatives seem to have different charge assignments or formal charges.

5. **Handling chirality**: The program does not currently consider chirality, which may be important for identifying specific alpha-amino-acid zwitterions.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. **Identify the NH3+ and COO- groups separately**: Use SMARTS patterns or substructure matching to identify the presence of an NH3+ group and a COO- group in the molecule.

2. **Check connectivity between NH3+ and COO- groups**: Ensure that the NH3+ and COO- groups are connected through a carbon atom (the alpha carbon).

3. **Allow for additional substituents on alpha carbon**: Instead of restricting to only one substituent, allow for additional substituents on the alpha carbon, but ensure that the connectivity between NH3+, COO-, and the alpha carbon is maintained.

4. **Handle ring structures**: Use more flexible SMARTS patterns or substructure matching techniques to handle ring structures containing alpha-amino-acid zwitterions.

5. **Consider chirality**: If necessary, incorporate checks for the correct chirality of the alpha carbon.

6. **Handle formal charges and charge assignments**: Be more flexible in handling formal charges and charge assignments, as these may vary depending on the specific molecule or the tools used for SMILES parsing.

7. **Incorporate additional checks or heuristics**: If needed, consider incorporating additional checks or heuristics based on the specific examples or domain knowledge, such as molecular weight ranges, specific functional groups, or other structural features.

It's important to note that while improving the program, you should also carefully analyze the false positives and ensure that the new approach does not introduce incorrect classifications.
