"""
Classifies: CHEBI:28765 phosphatidylinositol phosphate
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, I can see that the program has some limitations in correctly classifying phosphatidylinositol phosphates. Here are some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Glycerol backbone pattern**: The current pattern `"[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X4]"` is too strict and only matches a glycerol backbone with exactly two hydroxyl groups. However, in phosphatidylinositol phosphates, one of the hydroxyl groups is substituted with a phosphorylated inositol group. A more flexible pattern that allows for one substitution would be more appropriate.

2. **Ester group count**: The program currently checks for exactly two ester groups, but some phosphatidylinositol phosphates may have additional ester groups (e.g., in the case of phosphorylated inositol groups with multiple phosphate groups). It would be better to check for at least two ester groups instead of exactly two.

3. **Inositol ring pattern**: The current pattern `"C1(C(C(C(C(C1O)O)O)O)O)OP(=O)([O-,O])[O-]"` is too specific and only matches an inositol ring with a single phosphate group attached. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates can have multiple phosphate groups attached to the inositol ring in different positions. A more flexible pattern that allows for multiple phosphate groups in different positions would be more appropriate.

4. **Fatty acid chain pattern**: The current pattern `"[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]"` is too strict and only matches four-carbon chains. Fatty acid chains in phosphatidylinositol phosphates can have varying lengths, and it would be better to use a more flexible pattern that can match chains of different lengths.

5. **Molecular weight check**: The program currently does not include a check for molecular weight, which could be a useful additional filter to exclude small molecules that might match the structural patterns but are not phosphatidylinositol phosphates.

6. **Handling false positives and negatives**: The program should be more robust in handling false positives and negatives. It could be helpful to analyze the false positives and negatives and identify additional patterns or checks that could improve the classification accuracy.

In terms of the false positives and negatives provided in the outcomes, it seems that the program is correctly identifying molecules that contain a glycerol backbone with two fatty acid chains and a phosphorylated inositol head group. However, it is also classifying some molecules as false positives that may not strictly meet the definition of phosphatidylinositol phosphates.

Regarding the false negatives, it appears that the program is missing some molecules that do belong to the class of phosphatidylinositol phosphates. These molecules likely have structural variations not captured by the current patterns used in the program.

Overall, while the program has a good foundation, it could benefit from more flexible and comprehensive patterns to better capture the structural diversity of phosphatidylinositol phosphates. Additionally, incorporating molecular weight checks and improving the handling of false positives and negatives could further enhance the program's accuracy and robustness.
