"""
Classifies: CHEBI:18085 glycosaminoglycan
"""
Based on the outcomes provided, it seems that the current program has some issues in correctly identifying glycosaminoglycans. Here are my observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **False Negatives**: The program missed several structures that are labeled as glycosaminoglycans, such as Desferrioxamine X4, Tenuecyclamide D, and Clonostachysin A. This suggests that the current criteria may be too strict or missing some important structural features.

2. **Polysaccharide Backbone**: The polysaccharide backbone pattern "[OX2]~[CX4]~[OX2]~[CX4]~[OX2]~[CX4]" may be too specific and could be missing some variations in the glycosidic linkages or sugar ring conformations. Considering a more flexible pattern or combining multiple patterns might help capture a broader range of polysaccharide backbones.

3. **Aminomonosaccharide Residues**: While the program checks for the presence of aminomonosaccharide residues, it does not explicitly check for their abundance or distribution within the molecule. Some glycosaminoglycans may have a lower proportion of aminomonosaccharide residues, but still meet the definition of containing a "substantial proportion" of them.

4. **Sulfate and Carboxylate Groups**: The requirement for the presence of sulfate or carboxylate groups may be too strict. While these groups are common in glycosaminoglycans, their absence does not necessarily disqualify a molecule from being a glycosaminoglycan.

5. **Molecular Weight**: The molecular weight cutoff of 500 Da may be too low for some glycosaminoglycans, especially those with longer polysaccharide backbones or additional modifications.

6. **False Positives**: While the program did not generate any false positives in the provided outcomes, it is still possible that the current criteria could misclassify some non-glycosaminoglycan structures as glycosaminoglycans.

To improve the program, you could consider the following steps:

1. **Expand the polysaccharide backbone pattern**: Use a more flexible pattern or a combination of patterns to capture a broader range of glycosidic linkages and sugar ring conformations.

2. **Adjust the aminomonosaccharide residue criteria**: Instead of a strict count, consider calculating the proportion or distribution of aminomonosaccharide residues within the molecule, and set a reasonable threshold for what constitutes a "substantial proportion".

3. **Remove the strict requirement for sulfate or carboxylate groups**: While these groups are common in glycosaminoglycans, their absence should not be a disqualifying factor.

4. **Adjust the molecular weight cutoff**: Increase the molecular weight cutoff to accommodate larger glycosaminoglycans or consider using a range instead of a strict cutoff.

5. **Incorporate additional structural features**: Explore other structural patterns or properties that are characteristic of glycosaminoglycans, such as specific sugar ring conformations, glycosidic linkage patterns, or the presence of specific functional groups.

6. **Consider using machine learning techniques**: If the rule-based approach proves too challenging, you could explore using machine learning techniques to classify glycosaminoglycans based on a training dataset of known structures.

7. **Consult additional resources and literature**: Review the chemical literature and consult with experts in the field to gain a deeper understanding of the structural diversity and nuances of glycosaminoglycans, which could inform the development of more robust classification criteria.

It's important to note that the benchmark you are using may not be perfect, and there could be systematic mistakes or edge cases that don't align with the generally accepted definition of glycosaminoglycans. In such cases, it's reasonable to ignore outliers if your program's classifications are consistent with your understanding of the chemical class, but be sure to explain your reasoning clearly.
