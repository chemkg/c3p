"""
Classifies: CHEBI:24402 glycosphingolipid
"""
The previous program attempted to classify molecules as glycosphingolipids based on the presence of a ceramide backbone, carbohydrate residues, and glycosidic linkages, as well as molecular weight and composition checks. However, the approach had some limitations, which led to the poor performance observed in the provided outcomes.

Reasons for the poor performance:

1. **Oversimplified ceramide backbone pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used for identifying the ceramide backbone (`[N;X3;H2,H1;!$(N(*)-*=[N,O,S])][CX3](=O)[CH0;X2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH0;X2]`) is too restrictive and may not capture the structural diversity of ceramide backbones found in glycosphingolipids. For example, it does not account for variations in the length of the fatty acid chains or the presence of double bonds or substitutions.

2. **Insufficient carbohydrate residue pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used for identifying carbohydrate residues (`O[C@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)O)O)O)O`) only captures a specific type of monosaccharide (glucose or galactose). However, glycosphingolipids can contain a wide range of monosaccharides, including sialic acids (e.g., N-acetylneuraminic acid), as well as oligosaccharide chains.

3. **Incomplete glycosidic linkage pattern**: The SMARTS pattern used for identifying glycosidic linkages (`[O;X2][C@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@H](O1)O)O)O)O`) is too specific and may not capture all possible glycosidic linkage types and orientations.

4. **Incomplete molecular weight and composition checks**: While the molecular weight check can provide a rough filter, the threshold of 500 Da may be too low for some glycosphingolipids with larger carbohydrate residues or longer fatty acid chains. Additionally, the composition check based on carbon and oxygen counts may not be sufficient to distinguish glycosphingolipids from other classes of molecules.

Potential improvements:

1. **Expand the ceramide backbone pattern**: Use a more flexible SMARTS pattern or combine multiple patterns to capture the structural diversity of ceramide backbones, accounting for variations in chain lengths, double bonds, and substitutions.

2. **Incorporate diverse carbohydrate residue patterns**: Develop SMARTS patterns to identify various monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid) and oligosaccharide chains commonly found in glycosphingolipids.

3. **Refine the glycosidic linkage pattern**: Expand the SMARTS pattern or use multiple patterns to capture different types of glycosidic linkages and orientations.

4. **Enhance molecular weight and composition checks**: Adjust the molecular weight threshold based on the specific glycosphingolipid class or use a range instead of a single cutoff. Additionally, consider incorporating checks for the presence of nitrogen (for sialic acids) or other elements commonly found in glycosphingolipids.

5. **Utilize additional structural features**: Explore the use of other structural features specific to glycosphingolipids, such as the presence of fatty acid chains, sphingoid bases, or characteristic functional groups.

6. **Consider machine learning approaches**: If a comprehensive set of rules becomes too complex, consider exploring machine learning techniques, such as fingerprint-based classification or graph neural networks, which can learn the structural patterns from labeled data.

It's important to note that while the current program may not perform optimally on the provided benchmark, it can still serve as a starting point for further refinement and improvement. Additionally, if the program's classifications align with your understanding of the chemical class, you can consider the potential for systematic errors or inconsistencies in the benchmark data.
