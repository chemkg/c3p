"""
Classifies: CHEBI:76578 diradylglycerol
"""
Based on the previous code and the outcomes, it appears that the current program is too strict in its definition of a diradylglycerol, leading to false negatives for valid examples. Here's an analysis of the issues and potential improvements:

1. The glycerol backbone pattern is too restrictive. The current SMARTS pattern "[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X3]" requires exactly two oxygens attached to the glycerol backbone, but some examples have three oxygens attached. A more flexible pattern like "[CH2X4][CHX4][CH2X3,CH2X4]" would be better to accommodate all valid cases.

2. The ester/ether pattern "[OX2][CX3,CX3]=O" is too specific and only looks for ester groups (-O-C=O). It should also include ether groups (-O-C) and other types of substituents like alkyl and alk-1-enyl groups. A more general pattern like "[OX2][CX3]" or "[OX2][CX3,CX3]" would be better.

3. The chain pattern "[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]" is too restrictive and requires at least four connected carbon atoms. Some examples have shorter chains or branched chains, which would be missed by this pattern. A more flexible pattern like "[CX4,CX3]~[CX4,CX3]" or even "[CX4,CX3]" might be better.

4. The rotatable bond count check (n_rotatable < 5) is too strict and may exclude some valid examples with shorter chains.

5. The carbon and oxygen count checks are too strict and may exclude some valid examples with different compositions.

To improve the program, we could relax the SMARTS patterns and remove or adjust the rotatable bond count and atom count checks. Additionally, we could consider using more advanced substructure matching techniques or machine learning models to better capture the structural diversity of diradylglycerols.

It's important to note that some of the provided examples might be inconsistent with the definition of diradylglycerols, or there might be errors in the benchmark itself. In such cases, it's reasonable to ignore those outliers if the program's classifications align with the chemical understanding of the class.
