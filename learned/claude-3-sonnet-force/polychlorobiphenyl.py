"""
Classifies: CHEBI:53156 polychlorobiphenyl
"""
The previous program appears to be a good attempt at classifying polychlorobiphenyls, but there are a few potential issues and areas for improvement based on the outcomes:

1. **False positives**: The program is classifying some molecules as polychlorobiphenyls when they should not be. This could be due to the program not accounting for certain structural features or patterns that are not present in polychlorobiphenyls. For example, some of the false positives contain other ring systems or substituents that are not typically found in polychlorobiphenyls.

2. **False negatives**: The program is not identifying any false negatives, which is a good sign. However, with a relatively small test set, it's hard to say if the program will perform well on a larger and more diverse set of molecules.

3. **Biphenyl core pattern**: The current pattern used to identify the biphenyl core (`"c1ccccc1-c1ccccc1"`) may be too general and could match other aromatic ring systems. A more specific pattern, such as `"c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1"`, might be better.

4. **Chlorine atom positioning**: The program checks if the chlorine atoms are attached to a benzene ring, but it does not explicitly check if they are attached to the biphenyl core. This could lead to false positives for molecules with chlorine atoms attached to other ring systems.

5. **Molecular weight or other descriptors**: While not strictly necessary, incorporating additional checks based on molecular weight or other relevant descriptors could help improve the specificity of the classifier.

To improve the program, here are some suggestions:

1. **Refine the biphenyl core pattern**: Use a more specific SMARTS pattern to identify the biphenyl core, such as `"c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1"`.

2. **Check chlorine atom positioning**: Ensure that the chlorine atoms are attached to the biphenyl core by checking the atom environment or by using a more specific SMARTS pattern.

3. **Incorporate additional checks**: Consider adding checks for molecular weight, number of rings, or other relevant descriptors to improve the specificity of the classifier.

4. **Expand the test set**: While the provided test set is useful, expanding it with more diverse examples, including potential false positives and false negatives, could help identify edge cases and further refine the program.

5. **Analyze false positives**: Carefully examine the false positives and try to identify common structural features or patterns that could be used to exclude them from the classification.

6. **Handle special cases**: Some polychlorobiphenyls may have slightly different structures or substituents that the program may not currently account for. Consider handling these special cases explicitly.

By addressing these issues and incorporating additional checks and refinements, the program's accuracy and robustness in classifying polychlorobiphenyls should improve.
