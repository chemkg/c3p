Classifies: CHEBI:33709 amino acid
"""
Reasoning step:

The previous program attempted to classify amino acids based on the following criteria:

1. Presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
2. Presence of an amino group (-NH2, -NHR, or -NR2)
3. Absence of multiple amide bonds (to exclude peptides)
4. Presence of a single chiral center
5. Specific arrangement of the carboxylic acid and amino groups around the chiral center
6. Handling of potential zwitterionic forms

While these criteria cover many aspects of amino acids, there are a few issues and potential improvements:

1. The code assumes that all amino acids have a single chiral center, which may not always be the case (e.g., glycine, sarcosine).
2. The code does not explicitly check for the presence of a side chain, which is a characteristic feature of most amino acids (except glycine).
3. The code does not consider cyclic amino acids (e.g., proline) or amino acids with additional functional groups (e.g., serine, threonine).
4. The code does not handle cases where the carboxylic acid or amino group is part of a ring system (e.g., histidine).
5. The error related to `FindMolChiralCenters()` suggests that the RDKit version being used may have changed the signature of this function, which needs to be addressed.

To improve the program, we could consider the following modifications:

1. Remove the requirement for a single chiral center, or handle the case of achiral amino acids separately.
2. Check for the presence of a side chain (e.g., alkyl, aromatic, or functional group) connected to the chiral center.
3. Account for cyclic amino acids and amino acids with additional functional groups by using more flexible substructure matching patterns.
4. Handle cases where the carboxylic acid or amino group is part of a ring system by using appropriate SMARTS patterns.
5. Update the code to use the correct signature for `FindMolChiralCenters()` based on the RDKit version being used.

Additionally, it's worth noting that while the benchmark cases may not be perfect, they provide a good starting point for testing and refining the program. If there are clear outliers that contradict the chemical understanding of amino acids, it may be reasonable to ignore them, but with a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the decision.
