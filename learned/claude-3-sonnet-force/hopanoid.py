"""
Classifies: CHEBI:51963 hopanoid
"""
The previous code has a high accuracy (0.9998) and a reasonable F1 score (0.9773), suggesting that it is performing well in classifying hopanoids. However, let's analyze the false negatives and false positives to see if we can improve the program further.

False Negatives:
1. (32R,33R,34R)-bacteriohopanetetrol: This molecule should have been classified as a hopanoid as it contains the hopane skeleton and meets the other criteria. The issue seems to be that the SMARTS pattern used to detect the hopane skeleton is too specific and is missing this valid structure.

2. 3-Epimoretenol: This molecule also contains the hopane skeleton but was missed by the pattern.

3. 22-hydroxy-7-hopanone, Bacteriohop-6-enetetrol carbapseudopentose ether, 11-cyclohexyl-N-((2S,3S,4R,5S,6R)-2-((2S,3S,4R,5R,6R,7S)-7-((3S,3aS,5aR,5bR,7aS,11aS,11bR,13aR,13bS)-5a,5b,8,8,11a,13b-hexamethylicosahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]chrysen-3-yl)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyoctyloxy)-4,5-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)undecanamide: These molecules were missed due to the SMARTS pattern being too specific.

The false negatives suggest that the SMARTS pattern used to detect the hopane skeleton is too narrow and needs to be more general to capture all valid hopanoid structures.

False Positives:
There were no false positives, which is a good sign that the program is not over-classifying non-hopanoids as hopanoids.

To improve the program, we can try to generalize the SMARTS pattern for the hopane skeleton. Additionally, we can consider adding other checks or patterns to ensure that we capture all valid hopanoid structures without compromising specificity.

Overall, the program is performing reasonably well, but there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the false negatives by improving the detection of the hopane skeleton.
