"""
Classifies: CHEBI:84948 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
"""
Your previous program correctly identifies 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules based on the presence of the CoA head group, a fatty acyl chain of at least 12 carbons, and a saturated bond between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms in the fatty acyl chain.

The program seems to be working correctly, as evidenced by the high accuracy, precision, and recall scores. The fact that there are no false positives suggests that the program is not incorrectly classifying non-11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules as positive.

However, the outcome shows some false negatives, which means that the program is missing some true 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules. Let's analyze these false negatives and see if we can improve the program:

1. **3-oxodocosanoyl-CoA(4-)**: This molecule has the correct CoA head group and a fatty acyl chain of 22 carbons, but the program is missing it because it does not have a saturated bond specifically between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms. Instead, it has a carbonyl group (C=O) at the 3rd carbon position. This is a limitation of the current program, which assumes that the saturated bond is always between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms.

2. **(13Z)-3-oxodocosenoyl-CoA(4-)**: Similar to the previous case, this molecule has the correct CoA head group and a fatty acyl chain of 22 carbons, but with a double bond at the 13th position instead of a saturated bond at the 11th position.

3. **(13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosatrienoyl-CoA(4-)**: This molecule has multiple double bonds in the fatty acyl chain, and the program is missing it because it does not have a saturated bond specifically between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms.

4. **(3R,13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z)-3-hydroxyoctacosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-)**: This molecule has multiple double bonds in the fatty acyl chain and a hydroxyl group at the 3rd carbon position. The program is missing it because it does not have a saturated bond specifically between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms.

5. **(R)-3-hydroxylauroyl-CoA(4-)**: This molecule has a fatty acyl chain of only 12 carbons, and the program is missing it because the pattern it's looking for requires at least 13 carbon atoms.

6. **phytanoyl-CoA(4-)**: This molecule has a branched fatty acyl chain, and the program is missing it because it's looking for a linear chain pattern.

Based on these false negatives, it seems that the current program is too strict in its definition of an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It assumes that the saturated bond must be exactly between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms, and it does not account for other possible modifications, such as carbonyl groups, double bonds, or hydroxyl groups at other positions.

To improve the program, we could consider the following changes:

1. **Relax the requirement for the saturated bond position**: Instead of checking for a saturated bond specifically between the 11th and 12th carbon atoms, we could check for a saturated bond anywhere along the fatty acyl chain.

2. **Account for other modifications**: The program could be modified to allow for carbonyl groups, double bonds, hydroxyl groups, or other modifications in the fatty acyl chain, as long as there is a saturated bond present.

3. **Consider branched chains**: The program could be modified to consider branched fatty acyl chains in addition to linear chains.

4. **Adjust the minimum chain length**: The program could be modified to consider fatty acyl chains with fewer than 12 carbon atoms, as long as they meet the other criteria.

These changes would make the program more flexible and inclusive, potentially reducing the number of false negatives. However, it's important to strike a balance between being too strict and too permissive, as a very broad definition could lead to false positives.

Overall, the current program is a good starting point, but it could benefit from some refinements to better capture the diversity of 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) molecules.
