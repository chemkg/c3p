"""
Classifies: CHEBI:88061 polyamine
"""
The previous code attempted to classify molecules as polyamines by counting the number of primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups present, and checking if there were at least two such groups. It also tried to exclude molecules containing amide groups, as these are not considered polyamines.

However, based on the outcomes, the program had a low F1 score, indicating poor performance. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **False Positives**: Several molecules were wrongly classified as polyamines, despite not meeting the structural criteria. Examples include compounds with only one amino group, or those with other nitrogen-containing functional groups like nitroso, nitro, or imino groups. The program should be more specific in identifying amino groups and distinguishing them from other nitrogen-containing groups.

2. **False Negatives**: Some true polyamines were missed by the program. For example, cyclic polyamines like hexamethylenetetramine and 1,3,6,8-tetraazatricyclo[6.2.1.1(3,6)]dodecane were not recognized as polyamines. The program should be able to handle cyclic structures and identify amino groups in such structures.

3. **Amide Exclusion**: The program attempts to exclude molecules containing amide groups, as these are not considered polyamines. However, some true polyamines, such as 2,5-S,S'-dicysteinyldopa, contain amide groups but were correctly classified. The amide exclusion rule may be too broad and should be revisited or removed.

4. **SMARTS Patterns**: The SMARTS patterns used to identify amino groups may not be comprehensive enough. They may miss some amino group configurations or misidentify other nitrogen-containing groups as amino groups.

To improve the program, here are some suggestions:

1. **Refine Amino Group Identification**: Instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns, consider using a combination of RDKit's functional group identification tools and atom-by-atom analysis to more accurately identify amino groups. This could involve checking the hybridization state, bond orders, and neighboring atoms of each nitrogen atom to differentiate amino groups from other nitrogen-containing groups.

2. **Handle Cyclic Structures**: Modify the amino group identification process to handle cyclic structures, where amino groups may be part of the ring or connected to the ring.

3. **Revisit Amide Exclusion**: Reevaluate the need for excluding molecules containing amide groups. If necessary, refine the amide identification process to avoid excluding true polyamines with amide groups.

4. **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors**: In addition to amino group counting, consider using molecular descriptors like molecular weight, atom counts, and functional group counts to improve the classification accuracy.

5. **Explore Machine Learning Approaches**: If the rule-based approach continues to struggle, consider exploring machine learning techniques like random forests or support vector machines, trained on a curated dataset of polyamines and non-polyamines.

It's important to note that there may be some ambiguity or inconsistency in the benchmark data, as mentioned in the note. In such cases, rely on your understanding of polyamine structures and use your best judgment to refine the classification rules or identify potential errors in the benchmark data.
