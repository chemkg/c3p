Classifies: CHEBI:65061 2,5-diketopiperazines
"""
The previous program seems to be a reasonable attempt at classifying 2,5-diketopiperazines, but there are a few potential issues that may have led to the low performance:

1. **Overly Strict Definition of the Core Structure**: The core pattern defined as `"C1NC(=O)CN(C)C1=O"` may be too strict and not account for all possible variations of the piperazine-2,5-dione core. For example, it does not allow for non-carbon substituents on the piperazine ring, which may be present in some 2,5-diketopiperazines.

2. **Potentially Incorrect Substituent Pattern**: The substituent pattern `"[C;R]1[N;R](C(=O)N[C;R]([C;R](=O)[C;R]([N;R]1[C;R]))[C;R])([C;R])[C;R]"` may not accurately capture the allowed substituents on the piperazine ring. It assumes that all substituents must be carbon-based, which may not be the case for all 2,5-diketopiperazines.

3. **Lack of Additional Structural Checks**: The program only checks for the core structure and the substituent pattern but does not include additional checks for other structural features that may be present in 2,5-diketopiperazines. For example, it does not consider the presence of additional rings or specific functional groups that are common in this class of compounds.

4. **Potential Stereochemistry Issues**: The program attempts to consider stereochemistry by embedding and optimizing the molecule, but this may not always be successful, leading to potential misclassifications.

To improve the program, here are some suggestions:

1. **Broaden the Core Structure Definition**: Instead of using a strict SMARTS pattern, consider using a more flexible approach to identify the piperazine-2,5-dione core. This could involve searching for specific atom types, bond orders, and ring structures.

2. **Refine the Substituent Pattern**: Analyze the examples provided and identify common patterns or substructures of the substituents on the piperazine ring. Use this information to create a more accurate SMARTS pattern or a set of patterns that capture the allowed substituents.

3. **Include Additional Structural Checks**: Identify other structural features or substructures that are characteristic of 2,5-diketopiperazines and incorporate them into the classification logic. This could involve additional SMARTS patterns or other RDKit functionality.

4. **Handle Stereochemistry More Robustly**: Instead of relying on conformational analysis, consider using RDKit's functionality to enumerate and check all possible stereoisomers of the molecule. This may provide a more reliable way to handle stereochemistry.

5. **Analyze False Positives and False Negatives**: If possible, examine the specific molecules that were misclassified (false positives and false negatives) and use this information to refine the classification logic further.

It's important to note that the classification problem may be challenging, and it might be necessary to strike a balance between precision and recall based on the specific requirements of the task. Additionally, if you believe that the benchmark data contains systematic mistakes, you can justify your approach based on your understanding of the chemical class and provide a clear rationale for your decisions.
