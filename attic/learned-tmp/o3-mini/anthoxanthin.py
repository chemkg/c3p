def is_anthoxanthin(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a given molecule (via its SMILES string) is likely to be an anthoxanthin.
    
    Anthoxanthins are a subclass of flavonoids (often flavones or flavonols) with a characteristic
    2-phenylchromen-4-one (flavonoid) skeleton, generally decorated with hydroxyl groups and (often) glycosides,
    and are water-soluble pigments (white/colorless to yellow).
    
    The function uses several heuristic checks:
    1. The SMILES is parsed to a molecule.
    2. The molecule must contain the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid core.
    3. The molecule should have at least one free hydroxyl group.
    4. The molecule should contain at least three rings.
    5. The calculated logP (a measure of lipophilicity) is expected to be low for water‚Äêsoluble pigments.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as an anthoxanthin, False otherwise.
        str: A message explaining the reasoning.
