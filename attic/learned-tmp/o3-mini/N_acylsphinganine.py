"""
Classifies: N-acylsphinganine
A ceramide consisting of sphinganine in which one of the amino hydrogens is substituted by a fatty acyl group.
Improved version: The code now checks that the nitrogen in the sphinganine backbone has exactly two heavy-atom neighborsâ€”
one coming from the sphinganine chain and the other from the acyl group (which must include a carbonyl).

def is_N_acylsphinganine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an N-acylsphinganine based on its SMILES string.
    The molecule is expected to contain a sphinganine backbone fragment such as
    "N[C@@H](CO)[C@H](O)" and the nitrogen of that backbone must be acylated.
    In an N-acylsphinganine the nitrogen should be substituted by exactly one acyl group,
    meaning that its degree (number of heavy-atom neighbors) is 2:
    one attached to the sphinganine chain and the other attached to a carbonyl group.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as an N-acylsphinganine, False otherwise
        str: Reason for classification
