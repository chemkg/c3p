Classifies: medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-)
Definition: "An acyl-CoA oxoanion that results from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate groups of any medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3."
Heuristic criteria:
  1. Must have a CoA moiety inferred by the presence of an adenine ring (SMARTS: "c1ncnc2ncnc12").
  2. Must have exactly four negatively charged oxygen atoms (formal charge â€“1) from the phosphate/diphosphate groups.
  3. Must have a thioester group (S-C(=O)[#6]); from the carbonyl carbon, the contiguous acyl chain (including that carbon) must contain between 6 and 12 carbon atoms.
