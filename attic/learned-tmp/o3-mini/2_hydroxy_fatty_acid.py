def is_2_hydroxy_fatty_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 2-hydroxy fatty acid based on its SMILES string.
    A 2-hydroxy fatty acid is defined as a fatty acid with a carboxylic acid group
    and an -OH substituent on the carbon alpha (adjacent) to that carboxyl group.
    
    The procedure is:
      1. Parse the SMILES and add explicit hydrogens.
      2. Check basic criteria such as that the molecule is linear and contains enough carbons.
      3. Search for an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid substructure.
         Two patterns are attempted:
           a) A tetrahedral (sp3) alpha carbon: [CX4]([OX2H])C(=O)[O;H1]
           b) A trigonal (sp2) alpha carbon: [CX3]([OX2H])C(=O)[O;H1]
      4. If either pattern is found, the molecule is classified as a 2â€“hydroxy fatty acid.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is a 2-hydroxy fatty acid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
