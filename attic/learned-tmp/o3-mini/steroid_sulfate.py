Classifies: steroid sulfate
Definition: A sulfuric ester obtained by the formal condensation of a hydroxy group of any steroid
with sulfuric acid.
A valid steroid sulfate must contain:
  1. A steroid nucleus (approximated by a fused ring system of at least 4 rings with a high carbon ratio).
  2. A sulfate ester group (â€“OS(=O)(=O)[O or O-]) attached via an oxygen atom to one of the steroid carbons.

def is_steroid_sulfate(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a steroid sulfate based on its SMILES string.
    
    Steps:
      1. Parse the SMILES string to a molecule.
      2. Identify a steroid-like fused ring system: we look for a cluster of at least 4 fused rings,
         and we require that most of the atoms in these rings are carbons.
      3. Search for a sulfate ester group. Instead of using an overly strict SMARTS pattern,
         we iterate through oxygen atoms bonded to a sulfur atom (candidate sulfate group).
         For the candidate S atom, we check that it is attached to at least three oxygens (expected for a sulfate)
         and then check that the oxygen attached to S is also bonded to a carbon that is part of the steroid nucleus.
         
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule qualifies as a steroid sulfate, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
