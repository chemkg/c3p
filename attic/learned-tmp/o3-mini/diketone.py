"""
Classifies: CHEBI:46640 diketone
"""
"""
Classifies: A compound that contains exactly two ketone functionalities (diketone)

A diketone here is defined as a compound in which exactly two carbonyl (C=O) groups appear,
each with a carbon bound to two other carbons (thus excluding aldehydes and carbonyls bound to heteroatoms),
with no extra carbonyl functionality. In addition, we wish to avoid highly complex fused ring systems,
so we reject molecules that contain a large fused ring cluster (more than 3 fused rings).

def is_diketone(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule qualifies as a simple diketone based on its SMILES string.
    Our criteria require:
      - Exactly two ketone groups defined by the SMARTS: [#6][CX3](=O)[#6]
      - Exactly two carbonyl functionalities (matched with [CX3]=O)
      - Not containing a highly complex (fused) ring system (i.e. fused cluster of more than 3 rings)
