    """
    Determines if a molecule belongs to the para-terphenyl class based on its SMILES string.
    A para-terphenyl is defined as a ring assembly with a 1,4-diphenylbenzene skeleton (i.e. a central benzene ring 
    substituted at opposite (para) positions with two other benzene rings), possibly with additional substituents.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as para-terphenyl, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
