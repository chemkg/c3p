"""
Classifies: tetrahydrofuranone
Definition: Any oxolane (i.e. a 5-membered saturated ring containing one oxygen and four carbons)
with an oxo- substituent (a carbonyl group) attached on one of the ring carbons.
The oxo substituent may be attached directly (via a C=O) or through an acyl group.
We now ensure that the candidate oxolane ring is fully saturated (non‚Äêaromatic, single bonds only)
to avoid false positives from aromatic or fused rings.
