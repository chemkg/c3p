Classifies: Aromatic Amino Acid 
Definition: An amino acid whose structure includes an aromatic ring.
Improved criteria:
  - Must contain a carboxylic acid (or carboxylate) group.
  - Must contain at least one amino (Nâ€“H) group.
  - Must contain at least one aromatic ring.
  - Molecular size (heavy atom count) is checked to avoid peptides.

def is_aromatic_amino_acid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is an aromatic amino acid.
    
    To be classified as an aromatic amino acid, the molecule must:
      - Have a carboxyl group (protonated or deprotonated).
      - Have at least one amino group (as evidenced by a nitrogen with at least one attached hydrogen).
      - Contain at least one aromatic ring.
      - Not be too large (which would indicate a peptide or larger compound).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule meets criteria for an aromatic amino acid, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the decision.
