"""
Classifies: CHEBI:50523 butenolide
"""
After analyzing the previous program and the outcomes, it seems that the main issue lies in the specificity of the classification criteria. The program correctly identifies the presence of a 2-furanone skeleton and various substitution patterns; however, it lacks the ability to distinguish between butenolides and other classes of compounds that may also possess these features.

Butenolides are a specific class of gamma-lactones with a 2-furanone skeleton and specific substitution patterns. The current program does not account for the structural constraints that define butenolides, such as the presence of a four-membered lactone ring fused to the 2-furanone ring.

To improve the classification accuracy, the program should incorporate additional structural constraints that are characteristic of butenolides. Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Check for the presence of a fused lactone ring**: Butenolides have a four-membered lactone ring fused to the 2-furanone ring. This structural feature can be checked using SMARTS patterns or by analyzing the ring systems present in the molecule.

2. **Analyze the ring system**: Butenolides have a specific ring system consisting of a five-membered furanone ring fused to a four-membered lactone ring. This ring system can be identified and checked for specific substitution patterns or stereochemistry.

3. **Consider molecular weight and atom counts**: Butenolides typically have a relatively small molecular weight and specific atom counts (e.g., a specific number of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms). These properties can be used as additional filters to eliminate false positives.

4. **Incorporate machine learning models**: If a sufficient number of butenolide and non-butenolide examples are available, a machine learning model can be trained to classify compounds based on their structural features and SMILES strings.

5. **Use expert-curated rules or databases**: Consulting expert-curated rules or databases of known butenolides can provide additional guidance on the structural features and constraints that define this class of compounds.

By incorporating these improvements, the program should be able to more accurately classify butenolides and reduce the number of false positives and false negatives.
