"""
Classifies: 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine
Definition:
  A 3-sn-glycerophosphoserine compound having acyl substituents at the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions.
Heuristic approach:
1. Parse the SMILES and verify that the molecule contains a phosphorus atom (for the phospho group)
   and a chiral serine fragment defined by "[C@H](N)C(O)=O".
2. To find fatty acyl chains we iterate over all carbon atoms that are part of a carbonyl group:
   these carbons must have one double-bonded oxygen and one single-bonded oxygen (the ester oxygen).
3. For each such candidate, we identify the unique carbon substituent on the carbonyl carbon (the acyl chain,
   not the oxygen that links to the glycerol head-group) and measure the chain length.
4. The chain length is determined by a depth-first search that traverses only carbon atoms (atomic number 6)
   and does not cross back into the rest of the molecule (for example via the carbonyl carbon) once it has branched.
5. Only acyl chains with chain length â‰¥6 are accepted.
6. Exactly two acyl chains are expected.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine based on its SMILES string.
    The molecule must contain a glycerophosphoserine head-group (demonstrated by the presence of P and
    a serine fragment) and exactly two acyl chains (attached via ester bonds) that are sufficiently long
    (chain length of at least 6 carbon atoms, counting the carbonyl carbon).

    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine, else False.
