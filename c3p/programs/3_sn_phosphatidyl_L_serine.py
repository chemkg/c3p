"""
Classifies: 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine
Definition:
  A 3-sn-glycerophosphoserine compound having acyl substituents at the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions.
  
Heuristic approach:
1. Parse the SMILES and check for key atoms (phosphorus and nitrogen) that must be found in a phosphoserine.
2. Look for a simplified serine fragment (using the SMARTS "C(N)C(=O)O") so that the head-group is likely present.
3. Identify ester carbonyl centers typical of an acyl ester. We do this by iterating over all carbon atoms
   that are carbonyl centers (i.e. have a double-bonded oxygen) and also are bonded to a single-bonded oxygen.
4. For each such carbonyl we then identify the substituent that is a carbon (and hence likely the acyl chain)
   and compute the length of the carbon-only chain (the longest contiguous path of carbon atoms).
5. Count only those acyl substituents with chain length â‰¥6. We expect exactly two acyl chains (on sn1 and sn2).
6. Return classification True only if the molecule passes the above tests.

def is_3_sn_phosphatidyl_L_serine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine based on its SMILES string.
    The molecule must contain a glycerophosphoserine head-group (indicated by the presence of P,
    a serine fragment, and by the expected connectivity) and exactly two acyl chains (attached via ester bonds)
    that are sufficiently long (at least 6 carbons).

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine, else False.
