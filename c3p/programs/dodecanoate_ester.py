"""
Classifies: CHEBI:87659 dodecanoate ester
"""
"""
Classifies: any fatty acid ester in which the carboxylic acid component is lauric acid,
i.e. a dodecanoate (laurate) ester. This specifically means that the acyl chain must be exactly
CH3(CH2)10C(=O)O.

This version uses RDKitâ€™s SMARTS repetition syntax ([CH2;H2]){10} to require exactly 10 CH2 groups
between a terminal methyl group ([CH3;H3]) and an ester carbonyl group. Deviations (such as branching or
chain extension) will result in different hydrogen counts or repetition numbers, preventing a match.

    """
    Determines if a molecule contains a dodecanoate (laurate) ester group.
    A dodecanoate ester is defined as having an acyl moiety that is exactly:
      CH3(CH2)10C(=O)O

    The method proceeds as follows:
      1. The input SMILES is converted into an RDKit molecule.
      2. A SMARTS pattern is used that employs repetition syntax to demand:
           - A terminal methyl group ([CH3;H3]) (degree=1 automatically since extra bonds lower H count)
           - Followed by exactly 10 methylene groups ([CH2;H2]) via {10} repetition.
           - Followed immediately by a carbonyl connected to an oxygen, i.e. C(=O)O.
      3. If this exact substructure is found anywhere in the molecule, it is classified as a laurate ester.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule contains an exact laurate ester group, False otherwise.
        str: Reason explaining the classification.
