Classifies: 11-oxo steroid
Definition: Any oxo steroid that has an oxo substituent at position 11.
This heuristic implementation first attempts to detect a steroid nucleus,
defined as four fused rings (three six-membered and one five-membered) having
a union of atoms in a slightly relaxed range. Next it verifies that one of the nucleus atoms
or one of its immediate neighbors bears a ketone (C=O) group.
Note:
  This method is heuristic and may miss exotic cases.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 11-oxo steroid based on its SMILES string.
    It performs two steps:
      1) It searches for a steroid nucleus â€“ defined as a set of 4 fused rings 
         (three six-membered and one five-membered) whose combined atoms number 
         is within a relaxed range (15 to 23 atoms).
      2) It checks whether a ketone group (C=O) is present either on the nucleus 
         or directly attached to an atom of the nucleus.
         
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string for the molecule.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a 11-oxo steroid, False otherwise.
        str: A reason explaining the decision.
