Classifies: glycerophosphocholine
Definition: The glycerol phosphate ester of a phosphocholine.
A glycerophosphocholine molecule should include (i) a phosphate group bonded to a glycerol or glycerol-like moiety and
(ii) a choline headgroup (â€“OCC[N+](C)(C)C) attached via that phosphate.
Note: Many natural examples (e.g., phosphatidylcholines) contain additional acyl chains.

def is_glycerophosphocholine(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a glycerophosphocholine (GPC) based on its SMILES string.
    A glycerophosphocholine is essentially a glycerol phosphate ester of phosphocholine.
    
    Key criteria (not exhaustive):
      1. The molecule must contain a phosphorus atom.
      2. It must have a phosphocholine headgroup, i.e. a phosphate group linked to an oxygen that is in turn bonded
         to an ethylene chain ending in a trimethylammonium (choline) group: OCC[N+](C)(C)C.
         
    Due to variability in how the phosphate is drawn (protonated vs deprotonated), we will try several SMARTS
    patterns for the phosphocholine headgroup.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule to classify

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as glycerophosphocholine, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation of the result.
