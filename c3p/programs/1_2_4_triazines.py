Classifies: CHEBI:39410 1,2,4-triazines
"""
"""
Classifies chemical entities of the class 1,2,4-triazines.
Definition: Any compound with a 1,2,4-triazine skeleton â€“ a six-membered ring that is aromatic,
composed solely of carbon and nitrogen atoms (with exactly three of each) and in which some cyclic
permutation (in either forward or reverse order) of the connectivity gives the pattern:
N, N, C, N, C, C.
Improvements over the previous attempt:
  - Only aromatic rings are considered (both atoms and bonds).
  - After ordering the ring atoms by connectivity, the cyclic bond connectivity is verified.
  - The cyclic permutations (both forward and reverse) are checked for the precise pattern.

    """
    Determines if a molecule contains a 1,2,4-triazine skeleton based on its SMILES string.
    The skeleton is defined as a six-membered aromatic ring composed solely of carbon and nitrogen atoms 
    (with exactly three of each) and for which some cyclic permutation (in either forward or reverse order)
    of the ring atoms gives the pattern: N, N, C, N, C, C.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if a 1,2,4-triazine core is found, False otherwise.
