Classifies: The conjugate base of a fatty acid (i.e. fatty acid anion)
Definition: "The conjugate base of a fatty acid, arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of the corresponding fatty acid."
This version refines the search by ensuring:
  1. A deprotonated carboxylate group ([CX3](=O)[O-]) is found.
  2. The carboxylate carbon is terminal (has exactly one carbon neighbour).
  3. The alpha carbon (that unique carbon neighbour) is not heavily decorated with heteroatoms (only C or O allowed besides the carboxylate).
  4. The contiguous carbon chain length (starting from the carboxylate) is at least 4 carbons.
  
Note: This is a heuristic; one might refine the chain rules or thresholds.

def is_fatty_acid_anion(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a fatty acid anion based on its SMILES string.
    Uses several heuristics:
      - It must contain a deprotonated carboxylate group: [CX3](=O)[O-].
      - This carboxylate group must be terminal: its carbon must be attached to exactly one carbon (the alpha carbon).
      - The alpha carbon should only be bonded (besides to the carboxylate) to carbons or possibly an oxygen (to allow hydroxy variants).
      - The contiguous carbon chain (starting at the carboxylate and including the alpha carbon and its extension) is required to be at least 4 carbons long.
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is identified as a fatty acid anion, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
