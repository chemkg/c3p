Classifies: Sterol
Definition: Any 3-hydroxy steroid whose skeleton is closely related to cholestan-3-ol.
Improved strategy:
  1. Identify fused ring systems via RDKit ring info.
  2. Within each fused system, look for a candidate nucleus defined as a set of 4 rings 
     whose sizes (sorted) equal [5,6,6,6] and whose union contains ~16-19 carbon atoms.
  3. Verify that at least one of these nucleus carbons bears an external hydroxyl group.
If found, returns True and explanation; otherwise returns False and a reason.

def is_sterol(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is a sterol (a 3-hydroxy steroid) based on its SMILES string.
    
    The algorithm:
       1. Parses the SMILES and adds explicit hydrogens.
       2. Obtains the ring information from RDKit.
       3. Groups ring atoms that are fused (connected by ring bonds).
       4. In each fused component, iterates over all combinations of 4 rings.
          A valid steroid nucleus candidate must have rings whose sizes (sorted) equal [5,6,6,6] 
          and its union contains 16-19 carbon atoms.
       5. Verifies that at least one carbon in the candidate nucleus has an external hydroxyl 
          (an oxygen with at least one hydrogen attached that is not part of the nucleus).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): The SMILES string for the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a sterol, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification decision.
