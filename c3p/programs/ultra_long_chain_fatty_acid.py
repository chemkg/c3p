Classifies: ultra-long-chain fatty acid
Definition: Any very long-chain fatty acid which has a chain length greater than C27.
A fatty acid is identified as a molecule containing a carboxyl group (â€“COOH)
with an attached linear alkyl chain.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is an ultra-long-chain fatty acid, defined as having a total chain length > C27.
    The chain is defined as the continuous chain of carbons connected to the carboxylic acid group.
    
    For our purpose, we require that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid substructure,
    and we then search for the longest continuous carbon chain (starting from the alpha carbon attached
    to the carboxyl carbon) using a depth-first search. The chain length (number of carbons in the chain,
    including the carboxyl carbon) is then compared against the threshold of 27.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is an ultra-long-chain fatty acid, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for classification.
