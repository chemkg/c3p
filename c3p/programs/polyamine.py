Classifies: CHEBI:88061 polyamine
"""
The previous program attempted to classify polyamines by counting the number of amino groups and checking for the presence of carbon atoms. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Missed cases**: The program fails to identify several polyamines correctly, as indicated by the false negatives. Some of these cases involve complex structures with amino groups in different chemical environments, which are not adequately captured by the current rules.

2. **Overgeneralization**: The program classifies several non-polyamine compounds as polyamines (false positives). This is because the current rules only check for the presence of amino groups and carbon atoms, without considering the specific structural requirements for polyamines.

3. **Inorganic polyamines**: The program attempts to exclude inorganic polyamines by checking for non-organic atoms. However, this approach may not be robust, as some inorganic polyamines may still contain carbon atoms.

To improve the classification, a more sophisticated approach is needed that considers the specific structural features of polyamines. Here are some potential improvements:

1. **Substructure matching**: Instead of simply counting amino groups, use substructure matching to identify specific patterns that define polyamines. For example, look for amino groups separated by alkyl chains or aromatic rings.

2. **Functional group identification**: Utilize functional group identification techniques to locate and analyze the amino groups and their chemical environments. This could help distinguish between different types of amino groups (primary, secondary, aromatic) and their connectivity.

3. **Rule-based system**: Develop a set of rules that capture the structural requirements for polyamines. These rules could include constraints on the number and type of amino groups, the presence of specific substructures (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings), and the absence of certain functional groups or structural motifs that would disqualify a compound as a polyamine.

4. **Machine learning approach**: If a comprehensive set of rules becomes too complex, consider training a machine learning model on a dataset of known polyamines and non-polyamines. This approach could potentially generalize better to diverse chemical structures, but would require a substantial amount of high-quality training data.

5. **Hybrid approach**: Combine rule-based and machine learning approaches, where a set of rules is used to filter out clear non-polyamines, and a machine learning model is used to classify the remaining, more complex cases.

6. **Handling tautomers**: Polyamines can exist in different tautomeric forms, which may need to be considered during classification. This could involve generating and analyzing tautomers or using tautomer-invariant representations.

7. **Additional checks**: Incorporate additional checks or heuristics, such as molecular weight ranges, charge state considerations, or specific substructure exclusions, to further refine the classification.

Overall, classifying polyamines accurately is a non-trivial task that may require a combination of approaches and a more nuanced understanding of their structural characteristics.
