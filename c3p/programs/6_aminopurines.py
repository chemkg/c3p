"""
Classifies: CHEBI:20706 6-aminopurines
"""
Based on the outcomes, it appears that the previous code has some shortcomings in accurately classifying 6-aminopurines. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **False Positives**: The program classified several molecules as containing 6-aminopurines when they should not have been classified as such. This issue likely stems from the fact that the code only checks for the presence of the adenine ring system and does not thoroughly examine the rest of the molecule. Some of the false positives, such as "Beta NADP" and "purmorphamine," contain ring systems that mimic the adenine pattern but are not true 6-aminopurines.

   **Potential Improvement**: In addition to checking for the adenine ring system, the program should also ensure that the ring system is not part of a larger, non-6-aminopurine structure. This could involve checking for specific substructures or functional groups that are incompatible with 6-aminopurines.

2. **False Negatives**: The program missed several molecules that should have been classified as 6-aminopurines, such as "6-aminopurine-9-carboxylic acid methyl ester" and "6-hydroxymethyladenine." This issue likely arises from the molecular weight check, which may be too strict or not accounting for all possible 6-aminopurine derivatives.

   **Potential Improvement**: The molecular weight check could be relaxed or removed entirely, as it may be too limiting. Alternatively, the program could check for specific functional groups or substituents that are common in 6-aminopurine derivatives.

3. **Molecular Weight Range**: The molecular weight range used in the code (200-1500 Da) may not be appropriate for all 6-aminopurines. Some of the false negatives, such as "adenine" and "8-oxoadenine," have molecular weights below 200 Da.

   **Potential Improvement**: The molecular weight range could be adjusted or removed altogether, as it may not be a reliable indicator of whether a molecule is a 6-aminopurine or not.

4. **Handling of Charged Species**: The program does not seem to handle charged species well, as evidenced by the false positives and false negatives involving charged molecules (e.g., "8-oxo-dAMP(2-)" and "4'-phosphopantetheinyl-CoA disulfide(6-)").

   **Potential Improvement**: The program could incorporate additional checks or preprocessing steps to handle charged species more effectively, such as removing or neutralizing charges before performing substructure matching.

5. **Lack of Specific Examples**: The program does not seem to account for specific examples of 6-aminopurines provided in the problem statement, such as "(S)-3-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA" and "feruloyl-CoA."

   **Potential Improvement**: The program could be modified to include specific substructure matching or pattern recognition for the provided examples, ensuring that they are correctly classified as 6-aminopurines.

Overall, while the previous code makes a reasonable attempt at classifying 6-aminopurines, it could benefit from more comprehensive substructure matching, handling of charged species, and incorporation of specific examples or functional groups common in 6-aminopurine derivatives.
