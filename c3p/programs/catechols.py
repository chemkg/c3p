Classifies: Catechols (Any compound containing an o-diphenol component)

A catechol is defined as a molecule containing a benzene ring (6-membered aromatic ring)
with two adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) substituents. This implementation scans all aromatic rings,
and for each six-membered ring it looks for two adjacent atoms that are substituted with â€“OH.

    Determines if a molecule is a catechol (contains an o-diphenol component) based on its SMILES string.
