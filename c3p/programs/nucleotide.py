Classifies: Nucleotide
A nucleotide is defined as a nucleoside phosphate resulting from the condensation 
of the 3 or 5 hydroxy group of a nucleoside with phosphoric acid.
This function tests for:
   - Presence of at least one phosphorus atom (phosphate group)
   - A furanose sugar ring (5-membered ring with exactly 1 oxygen and 4 carbons)
   - A nucleobase-like aromatic heterocycle (an aromatic ring with at least 2 nitrogen atoms)
   - The phosphate group attached to the sugar ring.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a nucleotide based on its SMILES string.

    A nucleotide should contain a nucleoside (a sugar ring attached to a nucleobase)
    with a phosphate group esterified at the 3' or 5' hydroxy position.

    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule is classified as a nucleotide, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification.
