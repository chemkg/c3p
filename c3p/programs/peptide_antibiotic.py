"""
Classifies: CHEBI:25903 peptide antibiotic
"""
The previous program attempts to classify a molecule as a peptide antibiotic based on several criteria, including molecular weight, rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, presence of peptide bonds, amino acid residues, and ring systems. However, the outcomes show that the program has several limitations and misclassifies many molecules.

Here's an analysis of what went wrong and potential improvements:

1. **Limited amino acid residue patterns**: The program only checks for a few basic amino acid residue patterns, such as glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and asparagine. This is a significant limitation, as peptide antibiotics can contain a wide variety of amino acids. To improve, the program should include patterns for a more comprehensive set of amino acid residues.

2. **Failure to handle non-standard residues**: Some peptide antibiotics may contain non-standard or modified amino acid residues, which the current patterns would fail to recognize. The program should be extended to handle such cases or use a more sophisticated method for residue detection.

3. **Overreliance on ring systems**: The program assumes that the presence of ring systems indicates a non-ribosomal peptide (and hence, a potential peptide antibiotic). However, this assumption may not always hold true, as some ribosomal peptides can also contain ring systems. Additionally, some non-peptidic molecules may also have ring systems, leading to false positives.

4. **Lack of specificity**: The current criteria are quite broad and may classify many non-antibiotic peptides as peptide antibiotics. Additional criteria or filters may be needed to improve specificity, such as looking for specific substructures or functional groups common to peptide antibiotics.

5. **Limited handling of exceptional cases**: Some of the false positives and false negatives could be due to exceptional cases or edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. For example, the program may struggle with highly unusual or complex molecular structures.

To improve the program, consider the following:

1. **Expand amino acid residue patterns**: Include patterns for a more comprehensive set of amino acid residues, including non-standard and modified residues commonly found in peptide antibiotics.

2. **Incorporate substructure and functional group detection**: Instead of relying solely on ring systems, look for specific substructures or functional groups that are characteristic of peptide antibiotics.

3. **Use machine learning or knowledge-based approaches**: Consider using machine learning techniques or knowledge-based approaches to classify peptide antibiotics more accurately. These methods can learn from a large dataset of known peptide antibiotics and non-antibiotics, potentially improving the classification performance.

4. **Handle exceptional cases**: Identify and handle exceptional cases or edge cases that may cause misclassifications. This could involve adding specific rules or conditions to the program.

5. **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors**: Explore the use of additional molecular descriptors, such as topological indices, charge descriptors, or other relevant properties, which may provide valuable information for classification.

6. **Validate and refine the program**: Continuously validate the program against a diverse set of molecules, including known peptide antibiotics and non-antibiotics. Use the validation results to refine the criteria, rules, and patterns used in the program.

It's important to note that classifying peptide antibiotics based solely on their molecular structure can be challenging, as there may be exceptions or edge cases that defy the general rules. In some cases, incorporating additional information, such as biological activity data or expert knowledge, may be necessary to achieve more accurate classifications.
