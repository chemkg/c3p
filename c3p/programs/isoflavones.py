    """
    Determines if a molecule is an isoflavone (i.e. an isoflavonoid with a 3-aryl-1-benzopyran-4-one skeleton)
    based on its SMILES string.
    
    The strategy is two-fold:
      1. Identify the benzopyran-4-one core (i.e. the 1-benzopyran-4-one fused bicyclic system).
      2. Verify that at least one aromatic (phenyl) ring is substituted onto the core (typically at position 3).
         This is done by locating a phenyl ring that is connected to one or more of the core atoms.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule is classified as an isoflavone, False otherwise.
        str: Reason for the classification decision.
