"""
Classifies: flavonols
Definition: Any hydroxyflavone in which the ring hydrogen at position 3 of the heterocyclic ring is replaced by a hydroxy group.
In other words, the molecule must contain a 3-hydroxyflavone core.
Examples include tambulin, pinoquercetin, etc.

    Determines if a molecule is a flavonol based on its SMILES string.
