"""
Classifies: Flavonoid
Definition: A flavonoid is any compound whose skeleton is based on 
a 1-benzopyran core (a fused bicyclic ring system consisting of a heterocycle 
that contains an oxygen fused to an aromatic ring) with an exocyclic aryl substituent 
(i.e. an additional fully aromatic ring attached via a single atom, typically at position 2).

Heuristic implementation:
  1. Parse the molecule using RDKit and obtain all rings.
  2. Look for a pair of fused rings (sharing >=2 atoms) such that one ring contains an oxygen
     (the heterocyclic ring) and at least one of the pair is fully aromatic (the benzene ring).
     Their union is taken as a candidate benzopyran core.
  3. Look for an exocyclic aromatic ring (fully aromatic) that is attached to the candidate core 
     by exactly one atom.
     
Note: Some flavonoids also carry glycoside sugar moieties which should not affect the flavonoid core detection.
This heuristic is not foolproof given the diversity of flavonoid structures.

def is_flavonoid(smiles: str):
    """
    Determines if a molecule is (putatively) a flavonoid based on its SMILES string.
    
    Heuristic steps:
      1. Parse molecule and get ring data.
      2. Identify a candidate benzopyran core (fused bicyclic system) as a pair of rings
         that are fused (share at least 2 atoms), in which one ring contains an oxygen (to represent the heterocycle)
         and at least one ring is fully aromatic.
      3. Search for an exocyclic aromatic ring (fully aromatic) that attaches to the candidate core
         via exactly one atom (i.e. through a single bond).
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string for the molecule.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the molecule appears to contain a flavonoid skeleton, False otherwise.
        str: Explanation for the classification.
