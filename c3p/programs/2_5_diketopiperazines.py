Classifies: 2,5-diketopiperazines (Any piperazinone that has a piperazine-2,5-dione skeleton.)

This module defines a function is_2_5_diketopiperazines that, given a SMILES string,
returns a boolean and an explanation string. It determines whether the molecule contains
a 2,5-diketopiperazine core defined as:
    N - C(=O) - C - N - C(=O) - C
arranged in a six-membered ring.

    """
    Determines if a molecule is a 2,5-diketopiperazine based on its SMILES string.
    A 2,5-diketopiperazine is defined as any piperazinone that has a piperazine-2,5-dione
    skeleton. The core structure consists of a six-membered ring with the connectivity:
        N - C(=O) - C - N - C(=O) - C
    where the carbonyl groups (C with a =O) occur at positions 2 and 5 in the ring.
    
    This implementation checks all six-membered rings in the molecule and tests all cyclic
    orderings (rotations and reverse orderings) to see if one matches the above pattern.
    
    Args:
        smiles (str): SMILES string of the molecule

    Returns:
        bool: True if molecule has a 2,5-diketopiperazine skeleton, False otherwise.
