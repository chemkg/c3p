"""
Classifies: 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol
Definition:
    A phosphatidylinositol in which the inositol moiety is the 1D-myo isomer 
    and the phosphatidyl group is located at its position 1.
    
Heuristics in this implementation (improved):
1. Check that the molecule contains at least two ester bonds (a C(=O)O substructure).
2. Look through all six-membered rings that consist solely of carbon atoms. For each such ring,
   count substituents: expect exactly five free hydroxyl groups (oxygen with at least one hydrogen)
   and one oxygen that is NOT free â€“ but instead is linked to a phosphorus atom.
3. If a candidate inositol ring is found, follow the oxygen attached to P and then verify that the P atom
   is connected to exactly two ester bonds (i.e. two oxygens that are attached to carbonyl carbons).
This further check helps to ensure that the phosphatidyl group is diacyl and attached at the proper site.
Note: This is a heuristic method that uses substructure and connectivity analyses,
and it does NOT completely guarantee proper stereochemical assignment.
