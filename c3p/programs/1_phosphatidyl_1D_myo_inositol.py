"""
Classifies: 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol
Definition:
    A phosphatidylinositol in which the inositol moiety is the 1D-myo isomer 
    and the phosphatidyl group is located at its position 1.
    
Heuristics in this implementation:
1. Look for at least two ester bonds (simplified as the C(=O)O substructure).
2. Identify a candidate inositol moiety by finding a six-membered ring composed entirely of carbons
   in which the substituents are mostly â€“OH groups. In genuine 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol,
   one of the ring carbons (position 1) carries a phosphatidyl substituent (an oxygen connected to phosphorus)
   and the other 5 carbons have free hydroxyl groups.
   
Note: This is a heuristic approach (using substructure and ring substitution counts) and does not truly
validate stereochemistry. Real stereochemical validation of an inositol isomer is very complex.
