      <td>triterpenoid</td>
      <td>The structure in the image is a complex molecule that features a steroid-like backbone which is characteristic of triterpenoids. This class typically consists of 30 carbon atoms, arranged in a structure derived from six isoprene units, and possesses a four-ring structure. In addition, the structure is attached to several glucose moieties, indicating a glycosidic form which is common in natural triterpenoids. The complexity and the distinct steroid-like framework suggest that this is a triterpenoid with a high confidence level.</td>

      <td>The structure in the image is of beta-carotene, which is a tetraterpenoid. It consists of eight isoprene units forming a long chain with alternating double bonds, typical of carotenoids. Terpenoids typically fall into categories of monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), diterpenoids (C20), sesterterpenoids (C25), or triterpenoids (C30). Vitamin A precursors like beta-carotene are often classified as tetraterpenoids (C40), which does not fit into the traditional terpenoid categories listed.</td>

      <td>The structure shown is not a typical terpenoid. It consists of a central long-chain polyene structure with conjugated double bonds and terminal hexose sugars. This arrangement is characteristic of a carotenoid, specifically a xanthophyll due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups (multiple hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups). Carotenoids like xanthophylls are classified separately from typical terpenoids due to their unique structure and function, even though they share a common isoprene derivation pathway. Hence, it falls into the "other" category rather than the specific terpenoid classes listed.</td>

The core structure appears to be a complex carbocycle, a typical feature of diterpenoids, often observed in naturally occurring compounds derived from plants. The additional functional groups do not alter the classification as they are modifications often seen in natural product derivatives.</td>
